This is a site about games and how to play them.

## Why?

As Alan Ferg says in <cite>Playing Cards of the Apaches</cite> (p. 35):

> In the introductory remarks to her encyclopedic _All Cards on the Table_,
> renowned card historian Sylvia Mann talked about researching playing cards as
> “a limitless source of instruction and pleasure,” her “way into history.” She
> remarked (1990:Vol. I:9, 10), “Personally, I have acquired, through
> application and countless reference works and the talents of other collectors,
> some knowledge about a lot of subjects hitherto outside my interests...” This
> was equally true for the Waylands for four decades, and then for me, too. We
> pursued with enthusiasm a host of “peripheral” topics to ensure a complete
> understanding of the context of card playing in the New World: Copey trees,
> paper-making in Mexico, laws prohibiting gambling, how to prepare rawhide, the
> New World origin of Monte, how to date beads and buttons, the history of
> clothing in northern Mexico, Native American painting techniques and
> preparation of pigments, World’s Fairs, Papago place names, scanning electron
> microscope examinations of stubs of hairs on cards, archaeological excavations
> in New Mexico, Araucanian painted guanaco-hide cloaks from Chile, Santa Anita
> Race Track, John Wayne movies, and thumbnail sketches of a seemingly endless
> list of museum curators and U.S. Army personnel.

… have you read W. G. Sebald’s <cite>Rings of Saturn</cite>? Games are
a foothold into other cultures and other times.

## A note on languages

Where possible I have tried to supply terms in their original languages, in
preference to the romanized forms found in most books. The main reason for doing
this is that it’s possible to search using the original terms and find
references from the people who are actually playing these games.

However, since I am not fluent in any language other than English, this has been
difficult. If you have any corrections to supply then I am happy to update them.

Another reason is that romanization schemes change over time, so as time passes
it is increasingly hard to recover the original form. Using the original terms
where possible helps with this problem.
