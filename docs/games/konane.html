    <p><span id="index-konane" class="game-title" lang="haw">Kōnane</span> (sometimes also called <span lang="haw">mū</span>, which is also used to refer to draughts) is a traditional Hawaiian abstract game for two players.

<h2>History</h2>
<div class="asided">
<aside role="note">
<p><span class="footnote-marker">*</span> John F. G. Stokes (1875–1960, an Australian archæologist on Hawaii) suggested—with only a sliver of linguistic evidence—that it could be a distant descendant of Go, which had been transmitted by the survivors of Japanese shipwrecks<span class="citation" data-cites="Stokes"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-Stokes">1</a></sup></span> .</p>
</aside>
<p><span lang="haw">Kōnane</span> stands alone as a purely-abstract game in Hawaiian culture.<span class="footnote-marker">*</span>  However, it definitely existed before European contact, as it was described by Captain Cook’s voyage, which was the first to reach the islands (see below).</p>
</div>
<p>The game dates at least from the early 18th century, as it was played by Kahekili II (c. 1737–1794), who was high chief (<span lang="haw">aliʻi nui</span>) of Maui. Kahekili and his advisers possibly used the board, or at least the pieces, to plan battles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]here was no other king so genuinely accomplished in making war as King Kahekili of Maui and the actions on the battlefield plainly showed his knowledge of the checkers game of war. […] It was also said that at the house of Kahekili the heaps of little stones were maneuvered for battle strategy so that his generals need only fulfill their movements.<span class="citation" data-cites="KamehamehaAndHisWarrior"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-KamehamehaAndHisWarrior">2</a> (41)</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only were [the old <span lang="haw">kāhuna</span> of this land] seers, but some of them used the <span lang="haw">papa kōnane hoʻoneʻe ʻiliʻili</span> [<span lang="haw">kōnane</span> stones] to guide them in understanding the movements on the battlefield.<span class="citation" data-cites="KamehamehaAndHisWarrior"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-KamehamehaAndHisWarrior">2</a> (123)</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gods were also rumoured to enjoy <span lang="haw">kōnane</span>: the volcano goddess <span class="proper-noun" lang="haw">Pele</span> was said to play it at her home in <span class="proper-noun" lang="haw">Hale-maʻumaʻu</span> crater.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ellis17"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-Ellis17">3</a> (183)</sup></span></p>
<div class="asided">
<aside role="note">
<p><span class="footnote-marker">†</span> At the time of the entry quoted, Captain Cook himself had been killed. Upon returning to England, James King was the one who completed the official account of the voyage.</p>
</aside>
<p>The earliest written record we have of the game is from James King, who was an officer that sailed on board Captain Cook’s third voyage to the Pacific.<span class="footnote-marker">†</span>  In an entry dated March 1779, he wrote:</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very remarkable, that the people of theſe iſlands are great gamblers. They have a game very much like our draughts; but, if one may judge from the number of ſquares, it is much more intricate. The board is about two feet long, and it is divided into two hundred and thirty-eight ſquares, of which there are fourteen in a row, and they make uſe of black and white pebbles, which they move from ſquare to ſquare.<span class="citation" data-cites="VoyageToPacific"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-VoyageToPacific">4</a> (144)</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="asided">
<aside role="note">
<p><span class="footnote-marker">‡</span> Campbell arrived aboard the <em>Neva</em>, the first Russian ship to circumnavigate the world, on the 29th of January 1809, and left aboard the <em>Duke of Portland</em>, a whaler, on the 4th of March 1810. The <em>Duke of Portland</em> also carried a letter from King Kamehameha to King George III, see <span class="citation" data-cites="Hackler86">‌<a href="#ref-Hackler86">5</a></span>. More information about the ships is available in <span class="citation" data-cites="Jackson92">‌<a href="#ref-Jackson92">6</a></span>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Another early witness was Archibald Campbell, a Scottish sailor who visited Oʻahu from 1809–1810.<span class="footnote-marker">‡</span>  In his book, he described the game:</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>They have a game somewhat resembling draughts, but more complicated. It is played upon a board about twenty-two inches by fourteen, painted black, with white spots, on which the men are placed; these consist of black and white pebbles, eighteen upon each side, and the game is won by the capture of the adversary’s pieces.</p>
<p>Tamaahmaah [King Kamehameha I, rumoured to be the son of Kahekili II] excels at this game. I have seen him sit for hours playing with his chiefs, giving an occasional smile, but without uttering a word. I could not play, but William Moxely [Campbell’s interpreter], who understood it well, told me that he had seen none who could beat the king.</p>
<p>The game of draughts is now introduced, and the natives play it uncommonly well.<span class="citation" data-cites="AVoyageRoundTheWorld"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-AVoyageRoundTheWorld">7</a> (145)</sup></span></p>

<p>The game continued to be popular throughout the 19th century; William Brigham (first director of Hawaii’s state museum) reported that King Kalākaua (1836–1891) and his wife Queen Kapiʻolani (1834–1899) were “experts at konane”.<span class="citation" data-cites="Brigham08"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-Brigham08">9</a> (378)</sup></span></p>

<h3>The board</h3>
<p>The board (<span lang="haw">papakōnane</span> or <span lang="haw">papamū</span>) is a square or rectangular grid of pits (<span lang="haw">lua</span>). Traditionally, boards were carved out of wood and raised slightly off the ground for ease of play, or were made by scraping holes into a slab of volcanic rock. Games could also be played on the squares of a woven <span lang="haw">lauhala</span> mat.<span class="citation" data-cites="Emory24"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-Emory24">11</a> (85)</sup></span></p>
<p>Stone boards can be found all over the islands of Hawaii. Peter Faris’ ‘Rock Art Blog’ has <a href="https://rockartblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/hawaiian-rock-art-konane-game-boards.html">pictures of several of these boards</a>.</p>
<p>Traditional wooden boards are now hard to find. An image of a traditional carved board from <span class="proper-noun" lang="haw">Iolani</span> Palace can be seen in <a href="https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/content/see-iolani-palaces-hidden-relics-once-belonged-hawaiian-royalty">this Hawaiʻi Magazine article</a>. Wooden boards sometimes had a human molar inset in the central hole (<span lang="haw">piko</span>, ‘navel’), or in some cases in all the holes of the board.<span class="citation" data-cites="PeterBuck"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-PeterBuck">12</a></sup></span> In November 2017, an antique wooden board with shell inlay <a href="https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=6105340&amp;lid=1">sold at auction</a> for €150 000.</p>
<div class="asided">
<aside role="note">
<p><span class="footnote-marker">¶</span> The complete list of sizes found was: 8×8, 8×11, 8×13, 9×10 (2 boards), 9×13 (2), 10×10, 11×11, 11×13, 13×13, 13×15, 13×20, and 15×15.</p>
<p><span class="footnote-marker">*</span> One of these is also shown in <span class="citation" data-cites="CulinHawaiian">‌<a href="#ref-CulinHawaiian">13</a></span>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Historical board sizes vary greatly, and there is no standard size. King’s account implies a board of 14×17 squares, while Campbell’s account implies a 6×6 board. An archæological survey on the island of Lanai<span class="citation" data-cites="Emory24"><sup>‌<a href="#ref-Emory24">11</a> (84)</sup></span> found 14 boards, with sizes ranging from 8×8 to 13×20.<span class="footnote-marker">¶</span>  <span class="citation" data-cites="PeterBuck">‌<a href="#ref-PeterBuck">12</a></span> shows two 12×15 boards from the Bishop Museum.<span class="footnote-marker">*</span> </p>
</div>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="PeterBuck">‌<a href="#ref-PeterBuck">12</a></span> also describes another board in the Bishop Museum which has 10 rows that alternate in length between 6 &amp; 7 holes. This seems to be the same board described by <span class="citation" data-cites="Emory24">‌<a href="#ref-Emory24">11</a></span>, where the pits are set “quincuncially”. This is probably not a board for playing <span lang="haw">kōnane</span>, but for playing a game similar to <span lang="es">damas</span> (‘Spanish draughts’), which is known in Hawaii as <span lang="haw">mū</span>. However, it could also be used to play <span lang="haw">kōnane</span> by playing the game on the diagonal.</p>

<p>To begin, the first player removes a piece from the centre of the board (or one of the squares adjacent to that, on an even-sized board), or from any corner. The second player removes a piece adjacent to the first, and play commences with each player moving the pieces of the colour that they removed.</p>
<p>On their turn, a player must move a single piece by jumping it over an orthogonally-adjacent enemy piece into an empty hole, thereby capturing the enemy piece and removing it from the board. A piece may also make multiple captures in the same direction by jumping multiple times – this is called <span lang="haw">kāholo</span>, ‘to move quickly’.</p>
<p>The first player that cannot move any piece on their turn loses; draws are not possible.</p>
