### ‘Insect’ <ruby lang="ja">虫<rt lang="ja-Latn">mushi</rt></ruby>

<ruby lang="ja">虫<rt lang="ja-Latn">Mushi</rt></ruby> ‘insect’ is a game for
two players, also known as “honeymoon hanafuda”. It is played with a 40-card
[hanafuda]{lang="ja-Latn"} deck lacking the June & July cards. Special packs
called <ruby lang="ja">虫<rt lang="ja-Latn">mushi</rt>札<rt
lang="ja-Latn">fuda</rt></ruby> also exist, which only have the 10 months
required for this game. Some of them are even insect-themed! The game is popular
in the Osaka region, and so it is sometimes called
[Osaka-mushi]{lang="ja-Latn"}.
