[Leap-Frog]{.game-title id="index-leap-frog"} is a game for two or more players
in which the object is to capture the most pieces from a board containing
identical pieces.

### Equipment

To play you will need a gridded board (Murray [@Murray2, 93] suggests
15&times;15 to 18&times;18 squares), and enough pieces to fill all the spaces on
it. All the pieces are the same.

### Setup

Place one piece on each square of the board.

### Play

To start, the first player removes one piece and places it in front of
themselves. After this, the players take turns by jumping a piece (not
diagonally) over another into an empty space, and capturing the piece that was
jumped. Multiple pieces may be jumped in a turn, even changing direction, and
the player must capture as many as possible with the piece that was moved.

The game ends when no more captures can be made, and the player who captured the
most pieces is the winner.

## Variants

Murray [@Murray2, pp. 93–94] invented a variant in 1898. The undifferentiated
pieces are replaced by pieces coloured white, yellow, red, and green, in the
ratios 4:3:2:1. The pieces now count points according to these ratios (i.e.
green is worth 4 points while white is worth 1). To set up the board, the pieces
are arranged randomly on the squares, and the first player must remove a white
piece to begin. The player with the highest point value of pieces taken at the
end wins.

Another way to vary the game would be to play on a non-square or non-uniform
board.
