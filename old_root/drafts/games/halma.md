## History

George Monks, an American surgeon, developed the game after his brother (Robert
Monks) saw the game [Hoppity]{.game-title} while on a trip to England
[@HalmaHistory]. Monks was awarded US patent
[383,653](https://patents.google.com/patent/US383653A) for the game.

The game was named Halma by Thomas Hill (Robert Monks’ father-in-law) from the
Ancient Greek [ἅλμα]{lang="grc"} ([hálma]{lang="grc-Latn"}), ‘jump’.

The game was first published by E.I. Horsman in the USA. Milton Bradley also
published the game under the name ‘Halma’ for three years until they were forced
to change their version to ‘Eckha’ [@BradleysGames, p. 3].^[Note that the patent
lists “Milton Brodley” as a signer. I don’t know if this is a mistake or
something more.] Parker Brothers claims that George Monks later sold his patent
to them.

## Variants

### Star Helma

In 1892, Ravensburger (a German board game manufacturer) published
‘[Stern-Halma]{lang="de" .proper-noun}’ (Star Halma).

The board was changed into a star shape, and this allowed up to six players to
play at once. This game later became known as Chinese Checkers.

There is a version with 10 and a version with 15 pieces per player.
