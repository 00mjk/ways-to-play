[Peg Chow]{.game-title} is a [Halma](/games/halma.html){.game-title}-like game
for 2–4 players, published by Parker Brothers in 1938 [@PegShowAndTelka].

## Play

If played by 4 players, the game may be played as a partnership game, with
partners sitting opposite each other.

The goal of the game is to traverse the board with all of your pieces and
position them in the corresponding positions on the opposite side of the board.

### Moves

A piece may either make a ‘plain move’ of one step in any direction along the
lines, or it may ‘jump’ a series of short leaps in any direction. No pieces are
ever captured, and jumping is never mandatory.


## Telka

[Telka]{.game-title} is played in the same manner as [Peg Chow]{.game-title},
except that capturing is allowed.

Enemy pieces (only) are captured when jumped over in the *white* sections of the
board. The coloured sections are safe for all players.

The object of the game in [Telka]{.game-title} is to get *three* pieces into the
opposing side of the board, instead of all of them, since some may be captured.
