[Three Men’s Morris]{.game-title id="index-three-mens-morris"} is an ancient
[mill game](/families/mill-games.html) game for 2 players.

## Play

There are two ways to begin the game: either players take turns placing a piece
on one of the empty points, or the pieces are lined up on two opposite sides of
the board.

Starting the game by playing to the centre of the board is a forced win for the
first player, so usually this move is banned [@WinningWaysV3, p. 737].

Players then take turns moving a piece from one square to another. The first
player to get three pieces in a line (aside from on their starting locations, if
using the lined-up opening) wins.

## History & Names

As evidenced by the many boards carved into stone walls and seats in
cathedrals and monasteries, the game was played in England over a long period
– Murray[@Murray2, p. 41] dates it from after the Norman conquest in the 11th
century, and states that it was “well established by 1300.” However, the game
seems to have declined until in the 19th century it was not well known in
England; English visitors to Ireland describe it as an Irish game.

In 19th century Ireland, it was described as ‘universally’ played by the
peasantry and named [caisleáin gearr]{lang="ga"}^[Hyde [@Hyde, p. 211] wrote
this as “cashlan gherra”.] ‘short castle’ [@CrokerCrofton, p. 171], or ‘top
castle’ [@GentlemansMagazineLibrary, p. 257]. Other old names in the United
Kingdom come from areas such as Galloway (‘corsi-crown’) [@Gallovidian, 142] and
Cumberland (‘copped-crown’) [@Hyde, p. 211].

The name Three Men’s Morris seems to be a modern invention, based on the name
Nine Men’s Morris. In the past it was known by other names in England, such as
“knockings in and out” [@NotesOnTheAbbey, p. 20; @OnTheIndoorGamesOfSchoolBoys,
p. 321]. It has also been called Ovid’s Game, based on the similarity to a game
that is vaguely described in Ovid’s <cite lang="la">Ars
Amatoria</cite> [@WinningWaysV3, p. 736].

Murray [@Murray2] claims that a distinct game called ‘Nine Holes’ existed, but
I don’t believe that it was a separate game to Three Men’s Morris, as all the
references seem to track back to a single entry in Robert Nares’
<cite>Glossary</cite> [@NaresGlossary, p. 345].

TODO: rewrite following bits

Writing in 1694,[@Hyde, p. 211] Hyde said it (or the variant where 3 pieces line
up on each side to begin with) was called “Che-Lo” in Chinese (i.e.
[直六]{lang="zh"} [zhí liù]{lang="zh-Latn"} ‘straight six’^[Although he gives
a corrupted character that looks more like [有]{lang="zh"}]), “Hugjurè” in
Persian (probably [هجوره]{lang="fa"} “his majesty”, but he also said that each
player has 6 pieces).

In other parts of the world, it is known as Tapatan in the Philippines, or
[六卒棋]{lang="yue-Hans-HK"} ([luk<sup>6</sup> zeot<sup>1</sup>
kei<sup>4</sup>]{lang="yue-Latn-HK-jyutping"} ‘six man game’) in southern China
[@CulinPhilippine, p. 648].^[Note that @Bell confuses his sources here and
claims that @Hyde states that “Luk Tsut K’i” was played in the time of
Confucius.]

In Ghana and nearby countries it is called Achi, and played with diagonals and
no initial setup.^[I believe this should really be [Adji]{lang="ee"}, the name
of a plant (<cite>Caesalpinia bonduc</cite>) that has large seeds suitable for
gaming [@LocalPlantNames]. The same name is also used for a [mancala
game](/families/mancala-games.html), so the name appears to be generic for all
games played with these seeds.]

In Bengal the game has been called [তাঁত ফাঁত]{lang="bn"} [Tant
Fant]{lang="bn-Latn"} (possibly meaning something like
‘[Loom-Schmoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shm-reduplication)’) or [তিন গুটি পাইত
পাইত]{lang="bn"} ([tin-guṭi pait pait]{lang="bn-Latn"}, ‘getting(?) three
pieces’). It is played with diagonals and lined-up setup.

To write up: Tapatan, Picaria.

See also: Picaria in [@Zaslavsky; @TicTacToe].

Also called (with diagonals) Hopscotch, in @MathematicalRecreationsMaurice [p.
267], but that name is better reserved for Picaria.

## Variants

### [Circular Three Men’s Morris]{.game-title id="index-circular-three-mens-morris"}

See [@HeimannLoop]. @Zaslavsky [p. 4–5] calls it
‘[Shisima]{id="index-shisima"}’, and says it is played in Kenya.^[The original
reference for this seems to be <cite>African Games of Strategy: A teaching
manual</cite> by Louise Crane, but I haven’t been able to view this work.] It
has also been published as ‘Tri-Pin’ by Louis Marx & Co., Swansea, UK.

### X-ceter-O

[X-ceter-O][] (or [X-für-O]{lang="de"} in Germany) has 6 pieces numbered #1–#6,
alternating between sides. The pieces must be placed or moved in order (and can
leap to any unoccupied square), looping back to #1 after #6 has been moved.

### King

[King][] (Jim Wilkinson, 1985, Paradigm Games). A commercial implementation. No
first play to centre, and pieces may move on the long diagonals.

### Chung Toi

[Chung Toi][] (Reginald Chung, 1994, multiple publishers).

Each player’s pieces are octagonal, and have a cross incised upon the top. After
the placement phase, a piece can move one or two squares (jumping is allowed)
in any of the four directions that the cross is pointing, and may also rotate.
A piece may also rotate without moving instead.
