### History

[Oicho-Kabu]{lang="ja-Latn"} ([おいちょかぶ]{lang="ja"} ‘eight nine’), or simply
[Kabu]{lang="ja-Latn"} is a Japanese gambling game in the style of Baccarat.

The game originated in Japan but has been seen played by Indigenous Australians
in the Northern Territory, apparently being transferred there by Japanese
sailors working in the pearl industry [@NoteOnAMissingLink;
@CardGamesAmongAborigines].

with special cards called [kabufuda]{lang="ja-Latn"} [株札]{lang="ja"}. It can
also be played with [hanafuda]{lang="ja-Latn"} cards (by dropping two suits), or
with the A–9 from a standard deck of playing cards.
