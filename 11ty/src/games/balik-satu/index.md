<p class="lead"><Noun lang="ms">Balik Satu</Noun> (‘turn one’) is a Peranakan game played with <a href="/articles/cards/ceki/">Cherki cards</a>. The method of play is similar to Mahjong, with the goal being to collect five sets of three cards.</p>

## Equipment

<Noun lang="ms">Balik Satu</Noun> can be played by almost any number of people
as long as you have enough cards. My two sources give differing amounts of cards
per player. (I am inclined to prefer the rightmost column as it starts with the
simple example of two decks for two people, even though the book suggests that
up to 20 people can play with a total of 1&#x202f;200 cards!) Recall that a
<Noun lang="ms">Cherki</Noun> deck contains 60 cards, two of each type, so a ½
deck has 30 cards, one of each type.

## Play

Deal 7 cards to each player, an additional card to the first player, and then a
second round of 7 cards to each player. Set the remainder of the cards in the
middle of the table face-down, to form the stock. <strong>Alternately</strong>,
with a large number of people it is faster to wash-shuffle the cards in the
centre of the table and then for each person to draw 14 cards (15 for the
starting player).

The first player starts the game by discarding one card face-up to the middle.
Play in an anti-clockwise direction; the next player is the person to their
right.

On a player’s turn they can either take the last discard or the next face-down
card, and must discard a card to complete their turn. The goal is to form your
hand into five sets of three: a set can be three of the same rank (i.e. with the
same indices) or three of the exact same card, which is called a <span
lang="ms">mata</span> (‘eye’), or a ‘passport’ in Melaka. A player
<strong>must</strong> have at least one <span lang="ms">mata</span> to win, and
the winning card that completes the hand (making 15 cards) must be drawn from
the stock, not from a discard.

**Calling**: once a player has formed four sets in their hand and only needs one
card to win, they can “call” on their next discard. To do this, they discard and
then flick their discarded card with their finger. If they have formed at least
one <span lang="ms">mata</span> already, they call ‘<span
lang="ms">tan</span>’,{%fn%}This comes from Hokkien <span lang="nan">等</span>
<span lang="nan-Latn">tán</span> ‘wait’.{%endfn%} or else (if they are trying to
form a <span lang="ms">mata</span> for their last set) they call ‘<span
lang="ms">ceki</span>’.

A hand with four complete sets that can be called as ‘<span
lang="ms">ceki</span>’, hoping to turn the pair of identical {% cards '8' %}s
into a <span lang="ms">mata</span>.
{% imageEnd %}

Once any player has called, whenever a player draws from the face-down stock,
they must reveal the card before adding it to their hand. If it is the winning
card for a player who has called, the calling player takes it and wins the
round. When a player claims or draws a winning card they call ‘<span
lang="ms">sampei!</span>’ (‘arrived!’).

A player who has called can still change their hand if they think they can
improve it, by turning an existing mixed set into a <span lang="ms">mata</span>.
If they do this and have already called ‘<span lang="ms">ceki</span>’ they can
change their call to ‘<span lang="ms">tan</span>’.

### Scoring

The winner draws an additional card from the deck (hence the name of the game),
and this determines the value of their hand. Unmarked cards are worth their rank
value (1–9 points), and the red-stamped cards are worth more:

<div class="multi">
{% image 
    size="small"
    noborder=true
    alt=""
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CS9.jpg" %}
Red Nine scores 10 points.
{% imageEnd %}
{% image 
    size="small"
    noborder=true
    alt=""
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CRF.jpg" %}
Nyonya scores 11 points.
{% imageEnd %}
{% image

    noborder=true
    alt=""
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/COT.jpg" %}
Lau Chian scores 12 points.
{% imageEnd %}
</div>

A common rule is that if the drawn card is a rank-1 <span lang="ms">yeo</span>
card, then the winning player does not score and the round is played again.

To the value of the drawn card, the winner adds one point for each unmarked
<span lang="ms">mata</span>, and two points for each <span lang="ms">mata</span>
of red-stamped cards.

Finally, if the player won by completing a <span lang="ms">mata</span> (i.e.
they called ‘<span lang="ms">ceki</span>’),{%fn%}If the winner initially called
‘<span lang="ms">ceki</span>’ and later changed their call to ‘<span
lang="ms">tan</span>’, it does not count as calling <span lang="ms">ceki</span>.
The rules given in @ChikiCards also award 1 point for winning after calling
<span lang="ms">tan</span>, but this seems superfluous as the winner will always
win at least 1 point for their <span lang="ms">mata</span>.{%endfn%} then:

* if someone else drew the winning card from the stock (called <span
  lang="ms">ayam</span>, ‘chicken’), they earn an additional
  1,[@GatewayToOldSchoolGames p. 71] 5,[@TheBabas p. 162] or 10[@ChikiCards]
  points, or
* if they self-drew the winning card (called <span lang="ms">kandang</span>
  ‘cage’), they earn an additional 2,[@GatewayToOldSchoolGames p. 71]
  10,[@TheBabas p. 162] or 20[@ChikiCards] points.

The player is then paid their total score by <em>each</em> player. In
Singapore[@ChikiCards] this is done by paying 10¢ per point.{%fn%}This was 5¢ a
point in the 1970s[@TheBabas p. 162].{%endfn%}

In the case that a player is initially dealt a winning hand (<span
lang="ms">kandang tangan</span> ‘cage in hand’), they win instantly and double
the normal scoring (no calling bonuses will apply).

## Balik Lima Belas

<Noun lang="ms">Balik Lima Belas</Noun> (‘draw fifteen’) is a version of <Noun
lang="ms">Balik Satu</Noun> where the winner draws fifteen cards from the stock
instead of one. They must use these cards to try to improve their sets into
<span lang="ms">mata</span> by swapping cards of equivalent rank. Scoring is
calculated as one point for winning plus one point for each <span
lang="ms">mata</span> (so, always at least two points). In this form the
red-stamped cards do not score extra, but the calling bonuses for <span
lang="ms">ayam</span> and <span lang="ms">kandang</span> still apply.
