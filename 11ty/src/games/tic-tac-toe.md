title: Tic Tac Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players that is well-known to result in a
draw if played ‘rationally’.  Unlike most board games, pieces cannot be moved or
removed once placed, making it an ideal game to play with pen & paper.

## History

The origins of tic-tac-toe are unclear. Many sources claim that it dates from
antiquity, but to me it seems like a more recent invention—a degenerate version
of Three Men’s Morris. Mentions of it only appear in the 19th century, and the
game is very well suited to being played with chalk on slates—such as were used
by children in schools during this period. Indeed, @BerkshirePhrases [p. 164]
describes the game as “the first game taught to children when they can use a
slate pencil”.
