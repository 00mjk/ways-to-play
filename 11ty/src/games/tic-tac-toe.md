title: Tic Tac Toe
---

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players that is well-known to result in a
draw if played ‘rationally’.  Unlike most board games, pieces cannot be moved or
removed once placed, making it an ideal game to play with pen & paper.

## History

The origins of tic-tac-toe are unclear. Many sources claim that it dates from
antiquity, but to me it seems like a more recent invention—a degenerate version
of Three Men’s Morris. Mentions of it only appear in the 19th century, and the
game is very well suited to being played with chalk on slates—such as were used
by children in schools during this period. Indeed, @BerkshirePhrases [p. 164]
describes the game as “the first game taught to children when they can use a
slate pencil”.

However, there is an early antecedent of a game which is equivalent in play, if
not in presentation. [Alfonso X of
Castile’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_X_of_Castile) <cite>Book of
Games</cite>[@AlfonsoGames], published in 1283, includes the game <span
lang="es">alquerque de tres</span> which is played on a small merels board with
diagonals. Each player has three pawns which they place on the board one at a
time, taking turns. If a player can form three in a line then they win;
otherwise it is a tie. Later historians (even including [H. J. R.
Murray](/articles/people/hjr-murray)[@Murray2]) have muddied the waters by
describing this game as a three-men’s-morris game where the pieces can be moved
after being placed, but this is not supported by the original
manuscript.[@DimensionsOfBookOfGames p. 609]

Some of the earliest known written references to Tic-Tac-Toe in English occur in
Charles Babbage’s unpublished manuscript ‘Essays on the Philosophy of Analysis’
(1812–1820, now held in the British Library as Add. MS&nbsp;37202), although the
game is never mentioned by name.[@SourcesInRecreationalMathematics"] In 1842,
‘tit-tat-to’ again occurs in his notebooks, when he conceptualizes an automaton
that would play the game against a
human.[@SourcesInRecreationalMathematics][@ICommencedAnExamination]

It also appears in 1818 in an article on the [Lancasterian
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitorial_System), discussing children’s
games:[@LancasterianSystem]

> One boy who is acquainted with the popular game of <i>checkers</i>, <i>fox and
> geese</i>, <i>tit-tat-to</i>, <i>hop skip and jump</i>, and a thousand other
> childish amusements,  will communicate all he knows to his school companions
> with surprising facility.

In 1830, [Robert Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(Radical))
(an anti-clerical Radical, nicknamed “the Devil’s chaplain”) used tic-tac-toe as
an example of a children’s game in his sermon “The Star of
Bethlehem”:[@DevilsPulpit p. 7]

> Just as a fool, who has but seen the diagrams and delineations in the elements
> of Euclid, will make himself dead sure that all the mathematics in the world
> could have consisted in nothing more than in making hobscotches [hop-scotch],
> and catgallowses [a high-jump], and scratchcradles [cat’s cradle], to play at
> tit-tat-toe with.

## Terminology

In English, tic-tac-toe has gone by many names. It has been variously called
‘tit-tat-to(e)’, ‘tic(k)-tac(k)-to(e)’, ‘(n)oughts &amp; crosses’, ‘crisscross’,
‘tip-tap-toe’,[@Teesdale p. 136][@NotesAndQueriesS8V12 p. 333] ‘Exeter’s Nose’
(a pun on ‘<i>X</i>s and <i>O</i>s’),[@SourcesInRecreationalMathematics] or
‘kit-cat-cannio’.[@SuffolkWords p. 200]

Several of these names derive from old counting-out rhymes — think ‘eeny meeny
miny mo’ — that begin with ‘tit, tat, toe’. These rhymes date from at least the
early 18th century: in 1725, @ANewCantingDictionary described ‘Tit-Tat’ as “the
aiming of Children to go at first”.

The fullest expression of this rhyme is along the lines of:

> Tit, tat, toe,<br />
> My first go,<br />
> Three jolly butcher boys<br />
> All in a row;<br />
> Stick one up,<br />
> Stick one down,<br />
> Stick one in the old man’s crown!{%footnote%}Some sources (e.g. @NurseryWitch [p. 374]) give this last line as “… in the old man’s (burial-)ground!”; I have no idea what this means.{%endfootnote%}

Aside from its use as a counting-out rhyme, ‘tit-tat-to’ was used to refer to
any set of three lined-up objects — in [F. W. N. Bayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._N._Bayley)’s 1842
adaptation of the gruesome [Bluebeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard) fairy-tale, Mrs.
Bluebeard discovers that her husband has murdered his six previous wives,
and:[@ComicNurseryTales p. 19]

> […] —ah! no more!<br />
> She bumps her body down on the floor;<br />
> Down on the floor—and, Oh, my eye!<br />
> She looks as if she were ready to die!<br />
> It isn’t a case of “tit-tat-toe,”<br />
> And “three jolly butchers all of a row,”<br />
> But Oh . . . Oh . . . Oh . . ! ! !<br />
> It’s a double case of tit-tat-toe,<br />
> <span className="smallcaps">And Six Dead Women all of a Row.</span>{%footnote%}Supposedly this is a children’s book.{%endfootnote%}
