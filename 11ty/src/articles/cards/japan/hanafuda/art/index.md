<!-- excerpt -->

## Origins

In their original form, <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span> were courtly
competitions in which various objects were compared as to their qualities or
unique attributes:{%fn%}Although the same terminology of <span
lang="ja-Latn">awase</span> was also used for sports such as
cock-fighting.[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince" p. 165]{%endfn%} objects that were
judged in these competitions included artifacts such as fans or
paintings;[@BrocadeByNight p. 242] flowers and plants (chrysanthemums, iris
roots,[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince p. 163] wild pinks); animals (insects,
song&shy;birds[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince p. 163]); incense;
tea[@AnIntroductionToJapaneseTeaRitual p. 26]; or — what we are most interested
in here — shells.

The competitions were generally organized between two teams, named Left (who
began the game, and usually had higher-ranking members)<Footnote>In Japan, the
left-hand side was traditionally considered the dominant or “masculine” side
(see the [naming of shells below](#kai-awase-to-kai-oi)), the
opposite of European tradition. In the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period,
the Minister of the Left (<span lang="ja">左大臣</span>) outranked the Minister
of the Right (<span lang="ja">右大臣</span>).</Footnote> and Right, and
consisted of a series of rounds in which each team would present one item at a
time, often with accompanying poem. Another format involved the presentation of
a selection of objects on a miniature artificial garden or island called a <span
lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> (<span lang="ja">洲浜</span>), which was
constructured especially for the competition and which could be made out of
expensive wood or precious metals.

{% imageEnd %}

In 966, Emperor Murakami held a <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span>
competition on the 15th of the 8th month (the most important full moon of the
year). The construction of each team’s <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> is
recorded in the [<cite lang="ja-Latn">Eiga Monogatari</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiga_Monogatari):

> Both sides worked furiously, determined not to be outdone. The contestants
> from the Office of Painting submitted a painted landscape tray depicting
> flowering plants of heavenly beauty, a garden stream, and massive rocks.
> Various kinds of insects were lodged in a rustic fence made of silver foil.
> The artists had also painted a view of the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ōi</Noun>
> River, showing figures strolling nearby and cormorant boats with basket fires.
> Near the insects there was a poem.
>
> The Office of Palace Works presented an interesting tray, carved with great
> ingenuity to resemble a high tide, which they had planted with artifical
> flowers and carved bamboo and pines. Their poem was attached to a spray of
> fresh <span
> lang="ja-Latn">[ominaeshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrinia)</span>.[@JapaneseAristocraticLife
> p. 92]

These elaborate competitions could run all day; another famous competition held
by Emperor Murakami six years earlier (on the 30th day of the 3rd month of 960),
ran from 4 p.m. until dawn, when the drunken winning team exited while singing
and dancing. A courtier’s diary recorded the elaborate preparations made at the
palace:[@MuseInCompetition pp. 214–217]

> […] Special care was taken on this occasion as many eminent people of refined
> taste would be attending the event, and so new plants and flowers were
> carefully chosen and added to the garden. The Chamberlain Minor Captain <Noun
> lang="ja-Latn">Sukenobu</Noun> was in charge of the garden, and he had oak
> logs arranged like a fence and entwined with ivy so that it looked like a
> cedar forest. He also placed stepping stones here and there so that one could
> walk along on them. The garden gave the impression of a pastoral landscape and
> looked more delightful than usual.
>
> The blinds were replaced by new ones. The Emperor’s seat was arranged in the
> anteroom at the southern end of the gallery. The atmosphere was so pleasant
> that it defied description. […]
>
> […] The poems [of the Left] were engraved on the silver leaves of
> golden-yellow mountain roses placed in the <span
> lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>—truly a beautiful work of art of exquisite
> workmanship. The tables were made of rosewood and other wood. The design of
> the <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> was quite interesting and charming. The
> cover was of varied shades of dark red and wisteria were embroidered on it;
> the mat was of violet brocade. Then two court girls […] brought in another
> <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> for scoring, the design of which was
> wisteria tendrils made of gold and silver. A twig was to be removed each time
> a point was scored.

As mentioned in the last paragraph, a special <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>
could be used for scoring. During a contest in 1035 one side planted miniature
pine trees to track their score; at another in 1078, “the Left inserted arrows
with silver shafts and glass feathers into a target to mark their wins, and the
Right placed tiny replicas of musical instruments in a silver box inlaid with
crystal.”[@BrocadeByNight p. 243]{%fn%}Elaborate scoring tracks were [also used
for incense competitions](https://images.dnpartcom.jp/ia/workDetail?id=TAM000634).{%endfn%}

### An aside about span lang="ja-Latn">Uta-awase</span>

Out of all the types of competition, the most esteemed was to eventually be the
poetry match (<span lang="ja">歌合わせ</span> <span
lang="ja-Latn">uta-awase</span>). At first it was a competition like the others,
where the poem was treated as an <em>object</em> to be chosen and presented by
the competitor, the poet might not even be present, and more attention was paid
to the accompanying costumes and music than the quality of the
poetry.[@BrocadeByNight p. 242] 

The poetry competition was highly ritualized, where the result of a contest was
not only about who could compose the better poem; on average, authors of a
higher rank were more likely to win. In some cases, the winner of a round was
decided by convention, and furthermore, some poems could not lose. The first
poem presented by the Left team, a poem complimenting the host, or a poem by the
Emperor himself would <em>at worst</em> result in a draw.[@UtaawaseJudgments p.
102] At one competition [Emperor <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Uda</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Uda) (<span
lang="ja">宇多天皇</span>) awarded his own poem a draw, stating “how can an
imperial poem lose?”[@BrocadeByNight p. 244]

Later, during what <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ito Setsuko</Noun> terms the “silver
age” of <span lang="ja-Latn">uta-awase</span>,[@MuseInCompetition p. 207] the
work of the poet became more important, and poetry competitions were held
without the extravagant <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>. The competitions
became more austere and aware of the world outside the courtly realm; in 1083 a
planned grand competition was cancelled as it was thought to be inappropriate
given the unrest at the time.{%fn%}i.e., the [<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Genpei</Noun>
war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genpei_War){%endfn%} Smaller and more
intimate competitions were held with poetry as their focus. This doesn’t mean
that the proceedings were any less elaborate; the largest competition of this
type involved nine poets competing over 1500 rounds.

### <span lang="ja-Latn">Kai-awase</span> to <span lang="ja-Latn">Kai-ōi</span>

The earliest recorded {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn" word="kai-awase"
pronouncer="skent" file="pronunciation_ja_貝合わせ.mp3" %} (<span lang="ja">貝合
せ</span>, ‘shell competition’) contest dates from 1040, and was held at [the
Ise shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Grand_Shrine) by [Emperor
Go-Suzaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Suzaku)’s first daughter,
Princess <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nagako</Noun>. This was a competition very much in
the spirit of the other <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span> games, and
consisted of twenty rounds, each shell being presented with an accompanying
poem.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 269]

<span lang="ja-Latn">Kai-awase</span> developed from this early
comparing-competition form into a completely different style of game called
<span lang="ja-Latn">kai-ōi</span> (<span lang="ja">貝覆い</span>, ‘shell
covering’) that was based upon collecting matching pairs of shells. <span
lang="ja-Latn">Kai-awase</span> itself died out and there is no record of any
competitions taking place after the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun>
period.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 270] However, by the <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Edo</Noun> period, the two terms would be conflated, with <span
lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span> being used for the matching game as
well,[@KaiOi][@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 270] and today <span
lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span> is the term most commonly used for replica game
sets.

Four generations of women playing <span lang="ja-Latn" >kai-ōi</span>.<br />From
<cite lang="ja">女有職莩文庫</cite> (1866), by <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Okada
Tamayama</Noun> (<span lang="ja">岡田玉山</span>).
{% imageEnd %}

Unlike <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span>, the new game was exclusively
played with clam (<span lang="ja">蛤</span>) shells, and it offered definitive
terms for deciding the winner. In one method of play, the left-hand sides of the
shells — also termed the “male” or ‘ground’ (<span lang="ja">地</span>)
shells — were arranged face-down on the ground. The right-hand sides — the
“female” or ‘coming out’ (<span lang="ja">出</span>) shells — were then drawn
from their <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-oke</span> (<span lang="ja">貝桶</span>,
‘shell bucket’) one-by-one and the players would attempt to match them with
those on the floor. Whoever was the first to point out a (successful) match
would capture both halves of the shell, and the winner was the player who
collected the most shells.

Early instructional books for women from the <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Muromachi</Noun> period (1392–1573) include rules that state that
the game is played with twelve shells,{%fn%}A video showing how this game would
have been played can be seen
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4_bz-okxM).{%endfn%} which should be
arranged in a circle on the ground, and that the drawn shell should be placed in
the centre, with the pointed end (“head”) directed towards the highest-ranking
person in the room.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 270] Evidently the game could get
physical, as those same books warn that “to quarrel and remove shells by force
is something that only men and courtesans do.”

The monk <span lang="ja-Latn"
class="proper-noun">[Kenkō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshida_Kenk%C5%8D)</a>
(<span lang="ja">兼好</span>, <abbr title="died">d.</abbr> <abbr
title="circa">c.</abbr> 1352) also offered guidance in his book <cite>Essays in
Idleness</cite>, published around 1330:[@EssaysInIdleness p. 130] {%fn%}<Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Kenkō</Noun> goes on to apply this strategic advice as part of an
extended metaphor for good governance and living well: “In all things, do not
seek for distant advantage. Simply maintain correctly what is close to hand. In
the words of the Chinese sage [Duke Xiao of
Qing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Pu), ‘Do what is good, and ask no
questions of the future.’ Surely a ruler should also govern in this
way.”{%endfn%}

> him. Those who are good at the game seem not to go to the length of taking
> shells from distant players but limit themselves to those close at hand, yet
> they manage to acquire a large number.

While later depictions (such as the images above) usually represent the game as
only played by women, diary entries and paintings from the time show that the
game was originally played by everyone, often in mixed teams. Losing teams would
also request re-matches to try to beat the victorious
team.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 257]

Records of the imperial household indicate that the shell-matching game was
played formally nearly five hundred times over the period 1481–1589, sometimes
as many as nine times a month.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 257]

{% imageEnd %}

When played with many shells, the game must have been difficult, since the clues
that point to a match are solely the subtle shades and contours of the shell,
and the only way to test if shells truly match is to pick them up and attempt to
join them together. Considering that traditional sets could contain up to 360
shells,{%fn%}Modern replicas usually only have around 54.{%endfn%} this
was a game for a class of person who had a lot of leisure time on their hands.

Later the game set itself turned into a luxury item: the interior of the shells
was at first decorated with matching fabrics, and then elaborately painted or
even gilded. After the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kamakura</Noun> period (1333), it
became common to illustrate the shells with matching scenes from the [Tale of
Genji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji) (<span lang="ja">源氏物
語</span> {% pronounce word="Genji Monogatari" file="pronunciation_ja_源氏物語
.mp3" pronouncer="straycat88" lang="ja-Latn" %}) — the game is also played in
Chapter 45 of the novel itself. Other designs included shells with half of a
poem in each, so that the matching pair could be read as a complete poem; these
types of the game would eventually evolve into the <span
lang="ja-Latn">uta-garuta</span> (<span lang="ja">歌骨牌</span>) poetry cards.

{% imageEnd %}

A personal <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-ōi</span> set became a standard  part of a
noble bride’s wedding gifts, as the joining of the matching shells was symbolic
of the join&shy;ing of husband and wife in marriage. However, the elaborate sets
with their hand-painted and gilded interiors must have been ex&shy;pen&shy;sive
to create and only owned by the richest of families. Indeed, at times
restrictions were put in place so that <em>only</em> noble families of the upper
ranks were permitted to include the game in their bridal
trousseaux.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 265] When time came to hand over the
wedding gifts, it was customary for the <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-oke</span> to
be the first item presented.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 265]

### <span lang="ja-Latn">Hana-awase</span>

<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> seem to originate in a combination of the
themes of <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span> — matching sets, poetry,
conventionalized art — with the ideas introduced by the Portuguese playing
cards — a regular structure of <i>suits</i> divided into different <i>ranks</i>.

The two distinct schools of playing-card games first combined in the form of
<span lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span> (<span lang="ja">花合せ</span>) decks.
These early 18th century ancestors of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> (such
as the deck pictured below) show a very regular configuration of cards for each
flower, which evolved during the 18th and 19th centuries into the unusual
configuration of the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> deck.

    license="with-permission" %}
Some of the cards from a <span lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span> deck produced
circa 1704 (at least before 1710). This type of deck originally contained 400
cards but many are missing, and the extant set pictured here comprises cards
from several different packs. Note the chrysanthemum with <span
lang="ja-Latn">sake</span> cup in the third card on the top row.
{% imageEnd %}

While decks such as the above are obviously for a different style of game, most
of the imagery that would become part of the <span
lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> deck was already present.

At the moment it is unclear exactly how the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>
deck was developed from the <span lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span>
cards.<Footnote>I hope to expand on this in future!</Footnote> It seems that at
some point an enterprising manufacturer began to produce a stripped-down version
that Japanese <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> scholar <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Ebashi Takashi</Noun> (<span lang="ja">江橋崇</span>) calls the
<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Musashino</Noun> (<span lang="ja">武蔵野</span>) deck.

### Banning & Legalization

Some time after its introduction, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> games
were restricted as part of a total ban on gambling introduced during the <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Kansei</Noun> Reforms{%fn%}During the <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Kansei</Noun> Reforms, gambling was prohibited by the <span
lang="ja">博奕賭ノ勝負禁止ノ儀ニ付触書</span>, promulgated by Matsudaira
Sadanobu on the 12th of January, 1788.[@SatireWithinKibyōshi p. 44]{%endfn%}
(1787–1793). This ban was to remain in place for nearly 200 years until, in
1886, a bookstore owner in <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ōsaka</Noun> named <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Maeda Kihei</Noun> (<span lang="ja">前田喜兵衛</span>) decided to
open a store selling  <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>.

Things had already begun to change in 1885, after a ban on Western playing cards
(<span lang="ja">西洋かるた</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">seiyō karuta</span>) was
lifted due to complaints from foreign officials.[@EbashiHanafuda pp. 189–192]
<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Maeda Kihei</Noun>{%fn%}<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kihei</Noun>
appears to have been something of a rogue: he is somewhat infamous in the
philately community for selling collections of counterfeit stamps to
unsuspecting tourists.{%endfn%} became convinced through his reading of legal
texts that the selling of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> was not actually
prohibited, and he moved to <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Tōkyō</Noun> in December 1885
with a plan to open a <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hana&shy;fuda</Noun> shop. However,
he found that the local landlords refused to let to him, believing his business
illegal, and he was unable to convince news&shy;papers to print his
advertisements. In order to prove himself correct, he came up with a cunning
plan: he officially petitioned the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Tōkyō</Noun> police to
ban the sale of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hana&shy;fuda</Noun>. His petition was
declined, the police stating that the sale of <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hana&shy;fuda</Noun> was legal, and later that month he opened
his first shop in the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Yagenbori</Noun> neighbourhood of
[Chūō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D,_Tokyo) district in <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Tōkyō</Noun> (<span lang="ja">中央区薬研堀町</span>, now part of
<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Higashi–Nihonbashi</Noun>).  The shop was named “{%

during the pro&shy;hi&shy;bition period; in their case behind the doors of a
rice merchant named <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Minatoya</Noun> (<span lang="ja">湊屋
</span>).[@OishiTengudoHistory4]

### Changing Attitudes

Even after prohibition had ended, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> retained
a poor reputation, and gambling with the cards remained illegal. In 1892, <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Korekata Kojima</Noun> (<span lang="ja">児島惟謙</span>,
1837–1908), who was the head of Japan’s supreme court (<span lang="ja">大審院
</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">daishinin</span>), was accused along with five
other supreme court judges of gambling with <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>
(<span lang="ja">弄花</span>, <span lang="ja-Latn">rōka</span>). Due to a lack
of evidence, the case was dropped, but <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kojima</Noun>
accepted ‘moral responsibility’ for the scandal and resigned his
position.[@EmperorOfJapan p. 813]

Despite this “image problem”, playing <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>
became part of what it meant to be a <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span> (<span
lang="ja">紳士</span>) — that is, a modern, wordly gentleman.<Footnote>The
Japanese word <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span> had originally been coined in
order to translate the English “gentleman”,[@TheEastandtheIdeaofEurope p. [[32,
38]]] and was particularly associated with those who enthusiastically embraced
Westernization during the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</Noun> period.</Footnote>
The author <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Uchida Roan</Noun> (1868–1929) is said to have
joked:

<blockquote lang="ja">紳士の資格は？　弄花と蓄妾と負債と奔走。</blockquote>

> What are the qualifications of a <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span>? Gambling
> with <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>, keeping a mistress, being in debt,
> and running about.

Another commentator remarked ironically that “if you can’t play skillfully with
48 flower cards, you can’t be a <span lang="ja-Latn">sōninkan</span> [<span
lang="ja">奏任官</span>, a type of official appointed by the prime minister]”.

The author and politician [<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Suematsu
Kenchō</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suematsu_Kench%C5%8D) (<span
lang="ja">末松 謙澄</span>) described the attitude at the time in his 1905
English-language book @FantasyOfFarJapan [p. 176]:

> In times gone by no game of cards having any resemblance to gambling was
> played among the gentry; moral discipline forbade such. Since the introduction
> of European ideas, the rigidity of discipline has somewhat slackened and cards
> are now played to some extent. Nevertheless, people do not consider
> card-playing good taste. If they play they do so with some diffidence,
> somewhat in a similar way as smoking is done by ladies in European society
> nowadays.

However, despite his protestation in the book that “I do not care for playing at
cards, but I know the methods”, he goes on to give a detailed account of the
gameplay — far more than a casual observer would know!

a more nationalistic outlook. Interestingly, the iconography of their cigarette
brands overlaps significantly with that of later <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> brands — some examples include <span
lang="ja-Latn">dai&shy;tengu</span> (<span lang="ja">大天狗</span> “large
tengu”), <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Fuji</Noun> (<span lang="ja">冨士</span>), and
<span lang="ja-Latn">hinode</span> (<span lang="ja">日乃出</span>
“sunrise”) — and their chief logo was that of a red <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Tengu</Noun>, which is also strongly associated with <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>. It is unclear to me whether there is any real
link here or if the coincidence simply reflects the conventionality of
traditional Japanese art.{%endaside%}

Another popularizing force during this period was that of cigarette
manufacturers who began to include <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>-patterned cards in cigarette packages as
collectible items. The manufacturer <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Murai</Noun> Brothers
(<span lang="ja">村井兄弟商會</span>, founded by the “tobacco king” <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Murai Kichibei</Noun> (<span lang="ja">村井吉兵衛</span>) in
<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</Noun> in 1892) included tobacco cards which combined
<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> with Western playing cards. <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Murai</Noun> was a progressive company that enthusiastically
embraced Westernization across the whole of their business. They operated in
conjunction with Western tobacco companies such as the British-American Tobacco
Company, and many of their cigarette brands bore English titles. Where his
competitor <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Iwaya</Noun> would name a brand <span lang="ja">
日乃出</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">hinode</span> “sunrise”), <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Murai</Noun> used the English name “Sunshine”.

In 1899, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Murai</Noun> formed the subsidiary “Tōyō
Printing”{%fn%}In some sources this is given in its translated form as the
“Oriental Printing Company”.{%endfn%} (<span lang="ja">東洋印刷</span>), and
acquired printing equipment and training from the United States. With this
equipment they were able to produce high-quality packaging, and there is some
suggestion that they worked with <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</Noun> to produce
the first Western-style playing cards produced in Japan
(1902).[@EbashiCigaretteCards] Certainly <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</Noun>’s
early cards are often imitations of those produced by such US companies as the
National Card Company which had been merged with the United States Playing-card
Company in 1894.[@WOPCNCC]

In 1904, the Japanese government nationalized<Footnote><Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Kichibei</Noun> was compensated massively for being pushed out of
the industry and later founded a bank, among many other
enterprises.[@JapanInTheTaishoEra p. 632]</Footnote> the manufacture of all

### Taxation, Decline, and Revival

In 1902 a stamp duty was introduced that was inspired by similar taxes imposed
in Western countries, the intent being to raise the cost of cards (and thereby
dis&shy;cour&shy;age their use) but to also raise tax revenue. The tax imposed
was crushing: 20 <span lang="ja-Latn">sen</span> per set,{%fn%}The <span
lang="ja-Latn">sen</span> (<span lang="ja">銭</span>) was a unit of currency
representing 1⁄100 of a <span lang="ja-Latn">yen</span>.{%endfn%} in a time
when cheap <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> decks could be had for as little
as 2–3 <span lang="ja-Latn">sen</span>. The effect on card manufacturers was
“dire”, as Rebecca Salter puts it.[@PopularJapanesePrints p. 186] <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Ebashi</Noun> states that the law led to the closure of many
small producers, and made it much harder for new manufacturers to enter the
industry; both due to the tax itself as well as onerous record-keeping and
inspection requirements.[@CartaTaxLawContents]

During this period, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</Noun> managed to survive in
part by taking up the manufacture of regional patterns of Japanese cards (<span
lang="ja">地方札</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">chihōfuda</span>), whose original,
small-time, manufacturers had failed due to the new taxation law.[@NintendoHistory]

By the mid to late 20th century, interest in the game was waning. A poll by
Japan’s Cabinet Office in 1956 indicated that only 9% of people played <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>, compared with 28% who played with Western
playing cards.[@CabinetOfficeEntertainment]

Starting in the late 20th century, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> seems to
have had something of a revival. “Character” decks featuring popular <span
lang="ja-Latn">anime</span> and <span lang="ja-Latn">manga</span> characters
began to be produced, and the popularity of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>
has also been boosted by films featuring the cards, such as [<cite>Summer
Wars</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Wars) (2009).

While Japan produces many new types of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>
<em>cards</em>, in Korea <Noun lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</Noun> <em>games</em> appear
to be much more popular than their Japanese counterparts, and several films
about gambling with <Noun lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</Noun> — most prominently the
[<cite
lang="ko-Latn">Tazza</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazza:_The_High_Rollers)
series (2006, 2014, 2019) — have been box-office successes.

Image search results on Instagram (as of writing in 2021) for the hashtags

and
[<code>#화투</code>](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%ED%99%94%ED%88%AC/)
show about twice as many Korean-tagged images, despite Korea having only a third
of the number of Instagram users that Japan
has.[@JapaneseInstagramUsers][@KoreanInstagramUsers] The content of the images
also gives many clues to the game’s popularity: Korean images often show games
in progress, and many times being played for money, whereas Japanese images are
often just of the cards themselves, focusing on their æsthetic value.

## The Art of the Cards

The culture of the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Edo</Noun> period in which <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> cards first appeared was heavily
in&shy;flu&shy;enced by the aristocratic culture of the earlier <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period. As such, the artwork on the cards abounds
with references to <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period literature,
festivals, and artistic tropes:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

With the exception of the peony, which entered the poetic canon in the <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Edo</Noun> period, all the images are from classical poetry of
the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period and reflect urban commoners’
knowledge of the poetic and cultural associations of the months.[@FourSeasons
loc. 1739–1741]

</blockquote>

Artistically, the cards derive from the <span lang="ja-Latn">kachō-ga</span>
(<span lang="ja">花鳥画</span> ‘flower and bird image’) tra&shy;dition. Artworks
created in this style often have poems written upon them, and these appear on
some cards of the <span lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> pattern.

## Hanafuda Patterns

A playing-card ‘pattern’ is a common set of designs that has been used by
multiple different manufacturers over a period of time. With <span
lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> there is now one primary or “standard” pattern:
all other patterns are referred to as ‘local cards’ (<span lang="ja">地方札
</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">chihōfuda</span>), and considered to be specific to
a particular region. Most of these are of historical interest only and are no
longer manufactured, and there is little information about how gameplay differed
in different regions.


### Standard (<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hachihachi-bana</Noun>)

The standard pattern is now one that is called {% pronounce pronouncer="poyotan"
word="hachihachi-bana" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_八八花.mp3" %}
(<span lang="ja">八八花</span>/<span lang="ja">八々花</span>), since it was
primarily used to play the game <span lang="ja">八八</span> ‘88’. Almost all
decks use this pattern, and images from it are used to show the cards of each
month below.

    size="small"
    src='../5_brights.jpg'

{% imageEnd %}

#### Korean deck differences

Korean decks are also based on the <span lang="ja-Latn">hachi­hachi­-bana</span>
pattern, but the ribbons are usually blue instead of purple, and there is Korean
text on the standard three red ribbons (labelled <span lang="ko">홍단</span>, {%
pronounce lang="ko-Latn" pronouncer="glamstar77" word="hongdan"
file="pronunciation_ko_홍단.mp3" %} ‘crimson ribbon’) and all three blue ribbons
(<span lang="ko">청단</span>, {% pronounce lang="ko-Latn" word="cheongdan"
pronouncer="glamstar77" file="pronunciation_ko_청단.mp3" %} ‘blue ribbon’).

    src='Korean_tanzaku.jpg'
    alt="Six Hwatu cards showing ribbons with Korean text written on them." %}
Korean <Noun lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</Noun> cards with ribbons.
{% imageEnd %}

There are also differences in the ‘rain man’ (see below), and depending on the
deck, other aspects of the cards can also be translated into Korean cultural
terms. For example, the lesser cuckoo of the Japanese cards is in some decks the
Oriental magpie, which is the national bird of Korea.

<div class="multi">

    size="small"
    src='Magpie_vs_Hototogisu.jpg'
    alt="Two hwatu-format cards: the left shows cherry blossoms with a Korean magpie that has a blue chest with black and yellow wings, while the right shows cherry blossoms with a lesser cuckoo that has a yellow body and green wings." %}

cuckoo as shown on the Daiso <Noun lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</Noun>-format deck.

and very tall rain-clogs (<span lang="ja">足駄</span> {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn"

man is wearing a noble’s {% pronounce pronouncer="glamstar77" lang="ko-Latn"

</div>

### <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Mushi-bana</Noun>

The <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Mushi-bana</Noun> (<span lang="ja">虫花</span> ‘insect
flowers’) deck is a variant that contains only ten months, as it lacks the sixth
(peony) and seventh (bush clover). It is especially used for playing the game of
the same name, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Mushi</Noun> (‘insects’). It is sometimes
described as a shortened version of a standard <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hachihachi</Noun> deck, but in reality it originated as its own
regional pattern.

<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</Noun> produced this pattern until recently, but
it now appears to be extinct.

{% image
    src="nintendo_mushibana.jpg"
    alt="" %}
<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</Noun>’s <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Mushi</Noun> pattern
differs slightly from that of its standard deck.
{% imageEnd %}

### <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</Noun>

The regional {% pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" word="Echigo-bana" lang="ja-Latn"
file="pronunciation_ja_越後花.mp3" %} (<span lang="ja">越後花</span> ‘Echigo
flowers’) pattern is based on designs that are older than the standard pattern.
The most obvious difference is that all the cards are overpainted with gold and
silver in various patterns.

{% imageEnd %}

Some of the <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards also carry short poems (<span
lang="ja">短歌</span> {%pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" word="tanka"
lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_短歌.mp3" %}). Poetry is a common sight on traditional
Japanese art — as seen on the <span lang="ja-Latn">kachō-ga</span> prints
above — and often provides more context to the images. The poems of the <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</Noun> will be examined in more detail below.

### <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-kobana</Noun>

The {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn" word="Echigo-kobana" file="pronunciation_ja_越後
小花.mp3" pronouncer="poyotan" %} (<span lang="ja">越後小花</span> ‘Echigo small
flowers’) pattern is similar to the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</Noun>, but
with very small cards measuring approximately 3&nbsp;cm × 4.5&nbsp;cm (1⅛″ ×
1¾″).

Because of the small size, there are no poems on this deck. However, it does
contain four extra cards. Any special rules for the deck, including the use of
these extra cards, are unknown — <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi Tengudō</Noun> even
includes a note with every deck sold asking for anyone who knows the rules to
contact them!

This is another regional pattern called {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn"

### <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Dairen-bana</Noun>

<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Dairen-bana</Noun> (<span lang="ja-Latn">大連花</span>) is
an extinct regional pattern from city of [<Noun
lang="zh-Latn">Dalian</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian) (<span
lang="zh">大连市</span>) in China. It dates from the era of the [Kwangtung
Leased Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwantung_Leased_Territory), when
Japan occupied the region from 1905 until the end of WWII. The pattern possibly
existed as a way to reduce government taxation on cards, as cards sold in
occupied regions did not attract the same level of tax as those sold within
Japan’s own islands.

The main distinguishing feature of the pattern is that each type of <span
lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> card has its own background pattern (as opposed to
the usual ‘confetti’). The remainder of the cards follow the standard pattern
very closely.

{% image
    src="dairenbana.jpg"
    alt="Three hanafuda cards: the first, with a red ribbon with writing on it, has a background consisting of a wave pattern; the second, with a red ribbon without writing, has a diagonal-striped background; and the third, with a blue ribbon, has a hatched background." %}

### Modern/Novelty decks

In addition to the above, there are also many modern revisions or novelty decks
that do not conform to any one of the traditional patterns. More information and
examples of these can be found in the [article about new <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>
manufacturers](/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/new-manufacturers).

## The Cards in Depth

Firstly, a short note about the ordering of the deck: while nominally the cards
start in ‘January’, at the time the deck was created Japan’s calendar was based
upon the lunisolar Chinese calendar, which started in what is now February. This
explains why ‘March’ is the month of the cherry blossom when — according to the
current calendar — it should be April,<Footnote>In Kyoto from the 11th to 13th
centuries, the average peak of the cherry blossom season was April
17th.[@FourSeasons p. 484} pageType="l." /></Footnote> and why ‘August’ shows
the full moon when the full moon festival (<span lang="ja">月見</span> {%
pronounce pronouncer="skent" word="tsukimi" lang="ja-Latn"
file="pronunciation_ja_月見.mp3" %} actually falls in September–October.

However, even with these modifications the eleventh (willow) and twelfth
(paulownia) months are in the wrong place. The eleventh month depicts rain,
willows, and a frog, all of which are associated with summer.

In Korea, an altered ordering is used where the ‘November’ and ‘December’ months
are switched. There is also another ordering used in Japan which might be called
the “<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nagoya</Noun> ordering”, as it is used in several
games from that region.<Footnote>This order will be explained when I get around
to writing the games articles!</Footnote>

dwelling-place of immortals, is depicted as wooded with pine trees and populated
by cranes.

as the ‘pine week’ (<span lang="ja">松の内</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">matsu no

(<span lang="ja">黒豆</span> {%pronounce pronouncer="usako_usagiclub"
word="kuromame" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_黒豆.mp3" %}), due to
their appearance. This month shows the tran&shy;sition from spring to summer;
the lesser cuckoo (<span lang="ja">ホトトギス</span> {% pronounce
pronouncer="forsmith" word="hototogisu" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_ホ
トトギス.mp3" %}) is a bird of summer,[@FourSeasons loc. 1065] while wisteria is
associated with the passage of spring into summer;[@FourSeasons loc. 1021] it is
also known as the ‘two-season plant’ (<span lang="ja">二季草</span> <span
lang="ja-Latn">niki&shy;sou</span>). Like the bush warbler and spring, the first
cry of the cuckoo was considered to announce the beginning of summer. By the
time of the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Edo</Noun> period this was perhaps more of a
poetic dream than reality; the poet [<Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Buson</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosa_Buson) remarked
that he had only heard the bird twice, despite living in Kyoto for 20
years.[@TheClassicTraditionOfHaiku p. 56]

The cuckoo swooping in front of the moon is a common motif in Japanese art. It
is tempting to claim that this may be a reference to the tale of <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Yorimasa</Noun> from the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heike
Monogatari</Noun>,[@HeikeMonogatari pp. 161–3] but the oldest decks do not have

by <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kakinomoto no Hitomaro</Noun> <span lang="ja">柿本 人麻

<!-- {/*TODO: an image showing upside-down wisteria*/} --> 

In Korean contexts the non-<span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> wisteria cards are
almost always shown upside-down, so that the plants are presented in the same
manner as the bush clover in the seventh month. The cards are also referred to
as <span lang="ko">흑싸리</span>, “black bush clover”, possibly because wisteria
is not native to Korea. The <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card is never shown

One common species of bush clover in Japan is [<cite>Lespedeza
thunbergii</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lespedeza_thunbergii), named
after the Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg who visited Japan from 1775–6.
Oddly enough, Thunberg also collected some <span lang="ja-Latn">karuta</span>
decks during his stay, and was probably the first European to take one back to
Europe. His decks are now [in the Swedish Museum of Ethnography in
Stockholm](http://collections.smvk.se/carlotta-em/web/object/1000639). (Thanks
to Marcus Richert for pointing out this connection.)

The seventh month is represented by bush clover (<span lang="ja">萩</span> {%
pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" word="hagi" lang="ja-Latn"
file="pronunciation_ja_萩.mp3" %}). These cards are also nicknamed ‘red bean’
(<span lang="ja">赤豆</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">akamame</span>/<span
lang="ja">小豆</span> {% pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" word="azuki"
lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_赤豆.mp3" %}). Bush clover is very
strongly associated with autumn — the Japanese character <span lang="ja">萩
</span> is a composition of <span lang="ja">秋</span> ‘autumn’ and <span
lang="ja">艹</span> (full form <span lang="ja">艸</span>) ‘grass’.

Sadanobu</Noun>  (<span lang="ja">長谷川貞信</span>).
{% imageEnd %}

Bush clover is also (along with miscanthus, see the next month) considered one
of the “seven flowers of autumn” (<span lang="ja">秋の七草</span>), a term which
derives from a pair of poems in the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Man’yōshū</Noun> (book
8:1537–8):[@TheManyoshu p. 212]

<div class="multi">
    <p>
    The flowers that blow<br />
    In the autumn fields<br />
    When I count them on my fingers,<br />
    There they are—<br />
    The flowers of seven kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
    They are the bush-clover,<br />
    The ‘tail flower’, the flowers<br />
    Of the kuzu vine and patrinia,<br />
    The fringed pink, and the agrimony,<br />
    And last the blithe ‘morning face’.
    </p>
</div>

The bush clover is referred to in the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Man’yōshū</Noun> even
more than the plum or cherry blossoms.[@ElementsOfJapaneseDesign p. 54]

On the other hand, the wild boar pictured on the <span
lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card does not feature in any of the imperial poetry
collections. As a representative of rural life, it was considered to be outside
the boundaries of the aristocratic worldview of the poets. For the common
people, however, the boar was very important as a source of food. When [Emperor
Tenmu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Tenmu) banned the consumption of
meat in 675, only cattle, horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens were
prohibited.[@FourSeasons loc. 4261] Wild game such as boar and deer were not
included: either they escaped the imagination of the Emperor, or they were too
important as food sources for commoners.

The eighth month is represented by miscanthus or silvergrass (<span lang="ja">芒

The bold moon card is possibly the most well-recognized of all <span

day of the 8th month (<span lang="ja">中秋観月</span> <span

The tenth month is represnted by autumn leaves/maple (<span lang="ja">紅葉
</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">momiji</span>/{% pronounce pronouncer="El55"
word="kōyō" lang="ja-Latn" file='pronunciation_ja_紅葉.mp3' %}). The <span
lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card features a deer who is looking back over its
shoulder, sometimes inspecting a twig. A reference to this card, the ‘10-point
deer’ (<span lang="ja">鹿十</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">shikato</span>) has thus
become a slang term <span lang="ja-Latn">shikato</span> (<span lang="ja">しかと

While the leaves on the <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card are attached to a
tree, the leaves on the other cards appear to be floating on water. This could
be a reference to the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Tatsuta</Noun> river (<span

The cards for November show willow trees. There is one bright card, one <span
lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card, one red <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span>
card, and one <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> card.
{% imageEnd %}

The eleventh month is represented by willow (<span lang="ja">柳</span>
{%pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" word="yanagi" lang="ja-Latn"
file="pronunciation_ja_柳.mp3" %}); it is also often referred to as ‘rain’
(<span lang="ja">雨</span> {%pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" word="ame"
lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_雨.mp3" %}) or ‘drizzle’ (<span lang="ja">
時雨</span> {%pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" word="shigure" lang="ja-Latn"
file="pronunciation_ja_時雨.mp3" %}).

These cards have a strange relationship to the others — in many games they have
special powers, or they are valued lower than the cards of other months. For
ex&shy;ample, the bright of November will often score less than the other four
brights, and in some games the “lightning card” has special powers, such as
being able to match any other card.

It has been suggested (e.g. by author <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Murai Shōzō</Noun>
<span lang="ja">村井省三</span> and by <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi
Tengudō</Noun><Cite r="OishiSadakuro" />) that the running “Umbrella Man” has
its origins in the character of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Sadakurō</Noun> from the
<span lang="ja-Latn">bunraku</span> play <cite>The Treasury of Loyal
Retainers</cite> (<cite lang="ja">仮名手本忠臣蔵</cite> <cite
lang="ja-Latn">Kanadehon Chūshingura</cite>), written in 1748. However, as <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Ebashi</Noun> points out,<Cite r="EbashiSadakuro" /> the <span
lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span> deck pictured at the top of this article
contains an “Umbrella Man”. This precludes the <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Sadakurō</Noun> origin story, as the play was written some 40
years after that deck was produced.

The man pictured on the bright card is the poet <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ono no
Michikaze</Noun> (<span lang="ja">小野道風</span>), who is considered to be one
of the founders of Japanese calligraphy. The jumping frog re&shy;calls an
episode in his life: he had failed seven times to achieve a promotion, and was
considering abandoning his attempts. One day, walking beside a stream, he saw a
frog attempting to jump onto a willow branch. Seven times it jumped, and seven
times it failed. On the eighth attempt, the frog reached the branch
successfully. <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Michikaze</Noun> was thus inspired to
persevere with his attempts.[@AnimalInFarEasternArt pp. 86–7]

On older decks a different “rain man” is pictured. On these cards the man is
running in the rain with the umbrella closed around his head. This feature is
preserved in the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</Noun> pattern.

On the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-kobana</Noun>’s “rain man” card, the figure
has a bushy tail and appears to be either a <span lang="ja-Latn">kitsune</span>,
a Japanese fox/spirit; or a <span lang="ja-Latn">tanuki</span>, the raccoon-dog.
I am not sure of the significance of this.

The “lightning card” mentioned above is the red-coloured <span

Japanese (<span lang="ja">鬼札</span> {%pronounce  pronouncer="strawberrybrown"
word="onifuda" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_鬼札.mp3" %}). The drums,
which are visible in some patterns, are an attribute of the thunder god {%

The paulownia crest was most famously used by the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</Noun> family.
{% imageEnd %}

The twelfth month is represented by paulownia (<span lang="ja">桐</span>
{% pronounce pronouncer="kaoring" word="kiri" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_桐.mp3" %}).
This is a tree that flowers in spring, and has large heart-shaped leaves.

The paulownia as a symbol was originally used by the imperial family and ranked
second only to the chrysanthemum. Use of the paulownia was granted by [Emperor
<Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Go-Daigo</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Daigo)
to [<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ashikaga
Takauji</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_Takauji), whose
descendants used it until the end of the [<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ashikaga</Noun>
shogunate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_shogunate) in 1573. After
this, [Emperor <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Go-Yōzei</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Y%C5%8Dzei)
granted use of the crest to [<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi
Hideyoshi</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi) (1537–1598),
the second of the three “Great Unifiers” of Japan, and today it is most strongly
associated with the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</Noun> family. However, as
<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</Noun> in turn allowed its use by so many of his
allies, it is also now the most common crest in Japan.

In modern times, the paulownia symbol is also associated with the government.
This use started after the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</Noun> restoration, and it
appears on the seal of the prime minister’s office. There are many versions of
the crest, with the 3–5–3 flower version being most common. The 5-7–5 version is
of higher standing and is the one used by the government.

The wood of the paulownia is light and strong and often used for boxes; it is
very fast-growing and also somewhat fire-proof, so was useful as a storage
material. Older high-quality <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> decks came
encased in an outer box of paulownia wood. The manufacturer <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi Tengudo</Noun> still boxes many of their decks in this way.

The phoenix (<span lang="ja">鳳凰</span> {% pronounce pronouncer="akitomo"
word="hōō" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_鳳凰.mp3" %}, or <span
lang="zh-Latn">fèng&shy;huáng</span> in Mandarin Chinese) featured on the bright
card is from Japanese mythology, and was traditionally associated with the
empress of Japan. According to legend the phoenix will only land on a paulownia
tree. What appear to be ‘spikes’ on the card are really its long tail feathers.
This card is sometimes casually referred to as the “rooster” card.

One of the <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards is usually coloured, often
yellow, but sometimes with red as well. In some games it becomes a <span
lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card, or even a <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span>
card.

Usually (in Japanese decks) the manufacturer’s mark is on the coloured <span
lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> card, much like the ace of spades is used in European
decks. In Korean decks the mark can also be on the full moon card, or on the
jokers.
