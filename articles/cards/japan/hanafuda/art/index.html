consisted of a series of rounds in which each team would present one item at a
time, often with accompanying poem. Another format involved the presentation of
a selection of objects on a miniature artificial garden or island called a <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> (<span lang="ja">洲浜</span>), which was
constructured especially for the competition and which could be made out of
expensive wood or precious metals.</p><figure class="figure wide"><div class="multi"><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="qvH-Sy0a3h-800"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/qvH-Sy0a3h-800.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#qvH-Sy0a3h-800"><img class="figure-img" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/qvH-Sy0a3h-800.jpeg" srcset="/img/qvH-Sy0a3h-300.jpeg 300w, /img/qvH-Sy0a3h-600.jpeg 600w, /img/qvH-Sy0a3h-800.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, (max-width: 991.98px) 600px, 800px" width="800" height="1045"></a></div><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="Ara3KMiuoz-800"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/Ara3KMiuoz-800.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#Ara3KMiuoz-800"><img class="figure-img" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/Ara3KMiuoz-800.jpeg" srcset="/img/Ara3KMiuoz-300.jpeg 300w, /img/Ara3KMiuoz-600.jpeg 600w, /img/Ara3KMiuoz-800.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, (max-width: 991.98px) 600px, 800px" width="800" height="1049"></a></div></div><figcaption class="text-center figure-caption" itemscope><div id="src_TODOSRC"><p><span itemprop="caption">A depiction of the full-moon competition including two <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>, from an edition of unknown date.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/ri05/ri05_06661/index.html" itemprop="sameAs"><span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span itemprop="name">Waseda University</span></span></a> <a itemprop="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/" title="Public Domain">🅮</a></p></div></figcaption></figure><p></p><p>In 966, Emperor Murakami held a <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span>
competition on the 15th of the 8th month (the most important full moon of the
year). The construction of each team’s <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> is
recorded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiga_Monogatari"><cite lang="ja-Latn">Eiga Monogatari</cite></a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Both sides worked furiously, determined not to be outdone. The contestants
from the Office of Painting submitted a painted landscape tray depicting
flowering plants of heavenly beauty, a garden stream, and massive rocks.
Various kinds of insects were lodged in a rustic fence made of silver foil.
The artists had also painted a view of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōi</span>
River, showing figures strolling nearby and cormorant boats with basket fires.
Near the insects there was a poem.</p>
<p>The Office of Palace Works presented an interesting tray, carved with great
ingenuity to resemble a high tide, which they had planted with artifical
flowers and carved bamboo and pines. Their poem was attached to a spray of
fresh <span lang="ja-Latn"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrinia">ominaeshi</a></span>.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-JapaneseAristocraticLife">d</a>[p. 92]</sup></p>
</blockquote><p>These elaborate competitions could run all day; another famous competition held
by Emperor Murakami six years earlier (on the 30th day of the 3rd month of 960),
ran from 4 p.m. until dawn, when the drunken winning team exited while singing
and dancing. A courtier’s diary recorded the elaborate preparations made at the
palace:<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-MuseInCompetition">e</a>[pp. 214–217]</sup></p><blockquote>
<p>[…] Special care was taken on this occasion as many eminent people of refined
taste would be attending the event, and so new plants and flowers were
carefully chosen and added to the garden. The Chamberlain Minor Captain <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Sukenobu</span> was in charge of the garden, and he had oak
logs arranged like a fence and entwined with ivy so that it looked like a
cedar forest. He also placed stepping stones here and there so that one could
walk along on them. The garden gave the impression of a pastoral landscape and
looked more delightful than usual.</p>
<p>The blinds were replaced by new ones. The Emperor’s seat was arranged in the
anteroom at the southern end of the gallery. The atmosphere was so pleasant
that it defied description. […]</p>
<p>[…] The poems [of the Left] were engraved on the silver leaves of
golden-yellow mountain roses placed in the <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>—truly a beautiful work of art of exquisite
workmanship. The tables were made of rosewood and other wood. The design of
the <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> was quite interesting and charming. The
cover was of varied shades of dark red and wisteria were embroidered on it;
the mat was of violet brocade. Then two court girls […] brought in another
<span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> for scoring, the design of which was
wisteria tendrils made of gold and silver. A twig was to be removed each time
a point was scored.</p>
</blockquote><p>As mentioned in the last paragraph, a special <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>
could be used for scoring. During a contest in 1035 one side planted miniature
pine trees to track their score; at another in 1078, “the Left inserted arrows
with silver shafts and glass feathers into a target to mark their wins, and the
Right placed tiny replicas of musical instruments in a silver box inlaid with
crystal.”<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-BrocadeByNight">b</a>[p. 243]</sup><span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">Elaborate scoring tracks were <a href="https://images.dnpartcom.jp/ia/workDetail?id=TAM000634">also used

poetry match (<span lang="ja">歌合わせ</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">uta-awase</span>). At first it was a competition like the others,
where the poem was treated as an <em>object</em> to be chosen and presented by
the competitor, the poet might not even be present, and more attention was paid
to the accompanying costumes and music than the quality of the
poetry.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-BrocadeByNight">b</a>[p. 242]</sup></p><p>The poetry competition was highly ritualized, where the result of a contest was
not only about who could compose the better poem; on average, authors of a
higher rank were more likely to win. In some cases, the winner of a round was
decided by convention, and furthermore, some poems could not lose. The first
poem presented by the Left team, a poem complimenting the host, or a poem by the
Emperor himself would <em>at worst</em> result in a draw.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-UtaawaseJudgments">f</a>[p.
102]</sup> At one competition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Uda">Emperor <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Uda</span></a> (<span lang="ja">宇多天皇</span>) awarded his own poem a draw, stating “how can an
imperial poem lose?”<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-BrocadeByNight">b</a>[p. 244]</sup></p><p>Later, during what <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ito Setsuko</span> terms the “silver
age” of <span lang="ja-Latn">uta-awase</span>,<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-MuseInCompetition">e</a>[p. 207]</sup> the
work of the poet became more important, and poetry competitions were held
without the extravagant <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>. The competitions
became more austere and aware of the world outside the courtly realm; in 1083 a
planned grand competition was cancelled as it was thought to be inappropriate
given the unrest at the time.<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">i.e., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genpei_War"><span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Genpei</span>
war.</a></span> Smaller and more
intimate competitions were held with poetry as their focus. This doesn’t mean
that the proceedings were any less elaborate; the largest competition of this
type involved nine poets competing over 1500 rounds.</p><figure class="figure wide" itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="HpPW_NsYKf-1600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/HpPW_NsYKf-1600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#HpPW_NsYKf-1600"><img class="figure-img" itemprop="contentUrl url" src="/img/HpPW_NsYKf-1600.jpeg" width="1600" height="1012" alt="Ladies in elaborate traditional Japanese dress sitting in a circle around shells that are arranged face-down on the floor." srcset="/img/HpPW_NsYKf-300.jpeg 300w, /img/HpPW_NsYKf-600.jpeg 600w, /img/HpPW_NsYKf-800.jpeg 800w, /img/HpPW_NsYKf-1200.jpeg 1200w, /img/HpPW_NsYKf-1600.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, (max-width: 991.98px) 600px, 800px"></a><figcaption class="text-center figure-caption"><p><span itemprop="caption">Ladies playing a game of <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-ōi</span>.<br>From

“female” or ‘coming out’ (<span lang="ja">出</span>) shells — were then drawn
from their <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-oke</span> (<span lang="ja">貝桶</span>,
‘shell bucket’) one-by-one and the players would attempt to match them with
those on the floor. Whoever was the first to point out a (successful) match
would capture both halves of the shell, and the winner was the player who
collected the most shells.</p><p>Early instructional books for women from the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Muromachi</span> period (1392–1573) include rules that state that
the game is played with twelve shells,<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">A video showing how this game would

arranged in a circle on the ground, and that the drawn shell should be placed in
the centre, with the pointed end (“head”) directed towards the highest-ranking
person in the room.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-JapaneseGamesOfMemory">g</a>[p. 270]</sup> Evidently the game could get
physical, as those same books warn that “to quarrel and remove shells by force
is something that only men and courtesans do.”</p><p>The monk <span lang="ja-Latn" class="proper-noun"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshida_Kenk%C5%8D">Kenkō</a>
(<span lang="ja">兼好</span>, <abbr title="died">d.</abbr> <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1352) also offered guidance in his book <cite>Essays in
Idleness</cite>, published around 1330:<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-EssaysInIdleness">i</a>[p. 130]</sup> <span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote"><span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kenkō</span> goes on to apply this strategic advice as part of an
extended metaphor for good governance and living well: “In all things, do not
seek for distant advantage. Simply maintain correctly what is close to hand. In
the words of the Chinese sage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Pu">Duke Xiao of
Qing</a>, ‘Do what is good, and ask no
questions of the future.’ Surely a ruler should also govern in this
way.”</span></span></p><blockquote>
<p>If someone engaged in a game of shell matching neglects the shells in front of
him while he looks around to check what others might be hiding in their
sleeves or by their knees, his own shells will be snatched from in front of
him. Those who are good at the game seem not to go to the length of taking
shells from distant players but limit themselves to those close at hand, yet
they manage to acquire a large number.</p>
</blockquote><p>While later depictions (such as the images above) usually represent the game as
only played by women, diary entries and paintings from the time show that the
game was originally played by everyone, often in mixed teams. Losing teams would
also request re-matches to try to beat the victorious
team.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-JapaneseGamesOfMemory">g</a>[p. 257]</sup></p><p>Records of the imperial household indicate that the shell-matching game was

that point to a match are solely the subtle shades and contours of the shell,
and the only way to test if shells truly match is to pick them up and attempt to
join them together. Considering that traditional sets could contain up to 360
shells,<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">Modern replicas usually only have around 54.</span> this
was a game for a class of person who had a lot of leisure time on their hands.</p><p>Later the game set itself turned into a luxury item: the interior of the shells
was at first decorated with matching fabrics, and then elaborately painted or
even gilded. After the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kamakura</span> period (1333), it
became common to illustrate the shells with matching scenes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji">Tale of

became part of what it meant to be a <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span> (<span lang="ja">紳士</span>) — that is, a modern, wordly gentleman.<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">The
Japanese word <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span> had originally been coined in
order to translate the English “gentleman”,<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-TheEastandtheIdeaofEurope">p</a>[p. [[32,

Westernization during the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</span> period.</span>
The author <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Uchida Roan</span> (1868–1929) is said to have
joked:</p><blockquote lang="ja">紳士の資格は？　弄花と蓄妾と負債と奔走。</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>What are the qualifications of a <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span>? Gambling
with <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>, keeping a mistress, being in debt,
and running about.</p>
</blockquote><p>Another commentator remarked ironically that “if you can’t play skillfully with
48 flower cards, you can’t be a <span lang="ja-Latn">sōninkan</span> [<span lang="ja">奏任官</span>, a type of official appointed by the prime minister]”.</p><p>The author and politician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suematsu_Kench%C5%8D"><span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Suematsu
Kenchō</span></a> (<span lang="ja">末松 謙澄</span>) described the attitude at the time in his 1905
English-language book <a href="#ref-FantasyOfFarJapan"><cite>A Fantasy of Far Japan: Or, Summer Dream Dialogues</cite></a> (p. 176):</p><blockquote>
<p>In times gone by no game of cards having any resemblance to gambling was
played among the gentry; moral discipline forbade such. Since the introduction
of European ideas, the rigidity of discipline has somewhat slackened and cards
are now played to some extent. Nevertheless, people do not consider
card-playing good taste. If they play they do so with some diffidence,
somewhat in a similar way as smoking is done by ladies in European society
nowadays.</p>
</blockquote><p>However, despite his protestation in the book that “I do not care for playing at
cards, but I know the methods”, he goes on to give a detailed account of the
gameplay — far more than a casual observer would know!</p><div class="multi">

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> with Western playing cards. <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai</span> was a progressive company that enthusiastically
embraced Westernization across the whole of their business. They operated in
conjunction with Western tobacco companies such as the British-American Tobacco
Company, and many of their cigarette brands bore English titles. Where his

in Western countries, the intent being to raise the cost of cards (and thereby
dis­cour­age their use) but to also raise tax revenue. The tax imposed
was crushing: 20 <span lang="ja-Latn">sen</span> per set,<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">The <span lang="ja-Latn">sen</span> (<span lang="ja">銭</span>) was a unit of currency
representing 1⁄100 of a <span lang="ja-Latn">yen</span>.</span> in a time
when cheap <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> decks could be had for as little
as 2–3 <span lang="ja-Latn">sen</span>. The effect on card manufacturers was
“dire”, as Rebecca Salter puts it.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-PopularJapanesePrints">w</a>[p. 186]</sup> <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ebashi</span> states that the law led to the closure of many
small producers, and made it much harder for new manufacturers to enter the
industry; both due to the tax itself as well as onerous record-keeping and
inspection requirements.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-CartaTaxLawContents">x</a></sup></p><p>During this period, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> managed to survive in
part by taking up the manufacture of regional patterns of Japanese cards (<span lang="ja">地方札</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">chihōfuda</span>), whose original,
small-time, manufacturers had failed due to the new taxation law.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-NintendoHistory">y</a></sup></p><p>By the mid to late 20th century, interest in the game was waning. A poll by
Japan’s Cabinet Office in 1956 indicated that only 9% of people played <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>, compared with 28% who played with Western
playing cards.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-CabinetOfficeEntertainment">z</a></sup></p><p>Starting in the late 20th century, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> seems to
have had something of a revival. “Character” decks featuring popular <span lang="ja-Latn">anime</span> and <span lang="ja-Latn">manga</span> characters
began to be produced, and the popularity of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>
has also been boosted by films featuring the cards, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Wars"><cite>Summer

to be much more popular than their Japanese counterparts, and several films

of the number of Instagram users that Japan
has.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-JapaneseInstagramUsers">aa</a></sup><sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-KoreanInstagramUsers">ab</a></sup> The content of the images
also gives many clues to the game’s popularity: Korean images often show games

<section><h2 id="the-art-of-the-cards"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" class="permalink" title="link to section" href="#the-art-of-the-cards">#</a>The Art of the Cards</h2><p>The culture of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Edo</span> period in which <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards first appeared was heavily
in­flu­enced by the aristocratic culture of the earlier <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span> period. As such, the artwork on the cards abounds
with references to <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span> period literature,
festivals, and artistic tropes:</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>With the exception of the peony, which entered the poetic canon in the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Edo</span> period, all the images are from classical poetry of
the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span> period and reflect urban commoners’
knowledge of the poetic and cultural associations of the months.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-FourSeasons">ac</a>[loc. 1739–1741]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Artistically, the cards derive from the <span lang="ja-Latn">kachō-ga</span>
(<span lang="ja">花鳥画</span> ‘flower and bird image’) tra­dition. Artworks
created in this style often have poems written upon them, and these appear on
some cards of the <span lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> pattern.</p><figure class="figure"><div class="multi"><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="gu3GLXYxhf-600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/gu3GLXYxhf-600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#gu3GLXYxhf-600"><img class="figure-img border-0" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/gu3GLXYxhf-600.jpeg" srcset="/img/gu3GLXYxhf-300.jpeg 300w, /img/gu3GLXYxhf-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px" width="600" height="871"></a></div><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="1cGqJUgpJh-600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/1cGqJUgpJh-600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#1cGqJUgpJh-600"><img class="figure-img border-0" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/1cGqJUgpJh-600.jpeg" srcset="/img/1cGqJUgpJh-300.jpeg 300w, /img/1cGqJUgpJh-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px" width="600" height="859"></a></div><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="OECm35te0N-600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/OECm35te0N-600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#OECm35te0N-600"><img class="figure-img border-0" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/OECm35te0N-600.jpeg" srcset="/img/OECm35te0N-300.jpeg 300w, /img/OECm35te0N-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px" width="600" height="860"></a></div><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="jxzMd9Dw5V-600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/jxzMd9Dw5V-600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#jxzMd9Dw5V-600"><img class="figure-img border-0" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/jxzMd9Dw5V-600.jpeg" srcset="/img/jxzMd9Dw5V-300.jpeg 300w, /img/jxzMd9Dw5V-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px" width="600" height="860"></a></div></div><div class="multi"><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="CWmL64eNi3-600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/CWmL64eNi3-600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#CWmL64eNi3-600"><img class="figure-img border-0" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/CWmL64eNi3-600.jpeg" srcset="/img/CWmL64eNi3-300.jpeg 300w, /img/CWmL64eNi3-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px" width="600" height="859"></a></div><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="DBEG033tXe-600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/DBEG033tXe-600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#DBEG033tXe-600"><img class="figure-img border-0" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/DBEG033tXe-600.jpeg" srcset="/img/DBEG033tXe-300.jpeg 300w, /img/DBEG033tXe-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px" width="600" height="877"></a></div><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="lNg30HXf2o-600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/lNg30HXf2o-600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#lNg30HXf2o-600"><img class="figure-img border-0" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/lNg30HXf2o-600.jpeg" srcset="/img/lNg30HXf2o-300.jpeg 300w, /img/lNg30HXf2o-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px" width="600" height="852"></a></div><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image" itemref="src_TODOSRC"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="sXEBwgB6Vf-600"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/sXEBwgB6Vf-600.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#sXEBwgB6Vf-600"><img class="figure-img border-0" itemprop="contentUrl url" alt="" src="/img/sXEBwgB6Vf-600.jpeg" srcset="/img/sXEBwgB6Vf-300.jpeg 300w, /img/sXEBwgB6Vf-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px" width="600" height="865"></a></div></div><figcaption class="text-center figure-caption" itemscope><div id="src_TODOSRC"><p><span itemprop="caption">Art in the <span lang="ja-Latn">kachō-ga</span> style: a selection of prints

start in ‘January’, at the time the deck was created Japan’s calendar was based
upon the lunisolar Chinese calendar, which started in what is now February. This
explains why ‘March’ is the month of the cherry blossom when — according to the
current calendar — it should be April,<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">In Kyoto from the 11th to 13th
centuries, the average peak of the cherry blossom season was April

the full moon when the full moon festival (<span lang="ja">月見</span> <audio preload="none" src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_月見.mp3"></audio><span class="pronunciation" lang="ja-Latn" title="Pronunciation © ‘skent’ CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0, courtesy of Forvo.com." onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">tsukimi</span> actually falls in September–October.</p><p>However, even with these modifications the eleventh (willow) and twelfth
(paulownia) months are in the wrong place. The eleventh month depicts rain,
willows, and a frog, all of which are associated with summer.</p><p>In Korea, an altered ordering is used where the ‘November’ and ‘December’ months
are switched. There is also another ordering used in Japan which might be called
the “<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nagoya</span> ordering”, as it is used in several

people, however, the boar was very important as a source of food. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Tenmu">Emperor

prohibited.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-FourSeasons">ac</a>[loc. 4261]</sup> Wild game such as boar and deer were not

the second of the three “Great Unifiers” of Japan, and today it is most strongly
associated with the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</span> family. However, as
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</span> in turn allowed its use by so many of his
allies, it is also now the most common crest in Japan.</p><p>In modern times, the paulownia symbol is also associated with the government.
This use started after the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</span> restoration, and it
appears on the seal of the prime minister’s office. There are many versions of
the crest, with the 3–5–3 flower version being most common. The 5-7–5 version is
of higher standing and is the one used by the government.</p><p>The wood of the paulownia is light and strong and often used for boxes; it is
very fast-growing and also somewhat fire-proof, so was useful as a storage
material. Older high-quality <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> decks came
encased in an outer box of paulownia wood. The manufacturer <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi Tengudo</span> still boxes many of their decks in this way.</p><figure class="figure" itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="#!" hidden class="lightbox" id="PbvkNG-9Qc-1200"><span style="background-image: url(&#x27;/img/PbvkNG-9Qc-1200.jpeg&#x27;)"></span></a><a href="#PbvkNG-9Qc-1200"><img class="figure-img" itemprop="contentUrl url" src="/img/PbvkNG-9Qc-1200.jpeg" width="1200" height="1596" alt="A phoenix bird swoops down onto a paulownia tree." srcset="/img/PbvkNG-9Qc-300.jpeg 300w, /img/PbvkNG-9Qc-600.jpeg 600w, /img/PbvkNG-9Qc-800.jpeg 800w, /img/PbvkNG-9Qc-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 575.98px) 300px, 600px"></a><figcaption class="text-center figure-caption"><p><span itemprop="caption"><cite>Phoenix and Paulownia Tree</cite><br><cite lang="ja">桐に鳳凰</cite><br>by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Isoda Koryūsai</span> (<span lang="ja">礒田 湖龍斎
