Mill games are also known as <i>Morris</i> or <i>Merels</i> games. The main aim
of any mill game is to try to form a row of three pieces, which is called
a ‘mill’. In most games this allows the player to remove one of the opponent’s
pieces from the board (usually not from another mill).

Most mill games are split into two phases of <i>placement</i> and
<i>movement</i>.

## Games

Many of the games overlap so much that they could be considered to be the same
game. 

For example, [Morabaraba]{.game-title} as standardized by Mind Sports South
Africa has only two small differences from [Twelve Men’s Morris]{.game-title} as
standardized by the [Weltmühlespiel Dachverband]{lang="de" .proper-noun}.

The ‘base games’ are [Nine Men’s
Morris](/games/nine-mens-morris.html){.game-title}, [Three Men’s
Morris](/games/three-mens-morris.html){.game-title}, and [Twelve Men’s
Morris](/games/twelve-mens-morris.html){.game-title}. Games that are minor
variations on these are listed as variants in those pages. Games that are larger
variations, that have an interesting/distinct history, or that are otherwise
standardized (like [Morabaraba](/games/morabaraba.html){.game-title lang="st"})
are listed separately. (Although some ‘large variations’ like [Lasker
Morris](/games/nine-mens-morris.html#lasker-morris) are listed in the main pages
if they don’t have significant history or cultural background around them.)

If you are looking for somewhere to start, [Nine Men’s
Morris](/games/nine-mens-morris.html){.game-title} is probably the “classic”
game.

### Large mill board

* [Nine Men’s Morris](/games/nine-mens-morris.html){.game-title} is the most
  well-known, and can be viewed as the stereotypical mill game.
* [Twelve Men’s Morris](/games/twelve-mens-morris.html){.game-title} is common
  in the USA. [Eleven Men’s
  Morris](/games/twelve-mens-morris.html#eleven-mens-morris){.game-title} is
  a variant with one fewer piece per player.
* [Morabaraba](/games/morabaraba.html){.game-title} is a mill game played
  competitively in South Africa. It differs slightly from [Twelve Men’s
  Morris]{.game-title}.
* [Shax](/games/shax.html){.game-title lang="so"} is a mill game played in
  Somalia. It is distinguished by not permitting capturing during the placement
  phase.

### Medium mill board

* [Five Men’s Morris](/games/five-mens-morris.html){.game-title} or [Six Men’s
  Morris](/games/five-mens-morris.html#six-mens-morris){.game-title} is
  a mid-sized version that is less common than the bigger or smaller games.

### Small mill board

* [Three Men’s Morris](/games/three-mens-morris.html){.game-title} is a simple
  mill game that is known around the world.
* [Tic-Tac-Toe](/games/tic-tac-toe.html){.game-title} can be viewed as
  a degenerate mill game (and could derive from Three Men’s Morris?)
