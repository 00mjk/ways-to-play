[Shax]{lang="so" id="index-shax" .game-title} (pronounced ‚Äú<audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_so_shax.mp3"></audio><span class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">shah</span>‚Äù in Somali) is a [mill
game](/families/mill-games.html) from Somalia. In central and southern regions
of Somalia it is called [jare]{lang="so"} ‚Äòcut‚Äô [@IntroductionToShax, p. 1].

Unlike most mill games, captures cannot be made during the placement phase.

## Play

Each player begins with 12 pieces. 

### Placement phase

<figure class="side-image-r">

<figcaption>[Shax]{lang="so"} is played on the large mill board, without

Players take turns playing one of their pieces on a vacant point of the board.
Unlike [Twelve Men‚Äôs Morris](/games/twelve-mens-morris.html){.game-title},
completing a mill during this phase does not allow you to remove an opponent‚Äôs
piece.

Once all the pieces are on the board (and all 24 points are full), the player
who first completed a mill removes one of their opponent‚Äôs pieces. If neither
player completed a mill, the second player removes a piece.

### Movement phase

Starting with the player who first completed a mill, players take turns moving
one of their pieces along a line to a vacant space.

Each time a player forms a mill, they may remove an opponent‚Äôs piece, and
reducing the opponent to two pieces wins the game.

If a player is completely blocked, the other player must make a move that allows
them to move. If the ‚Äòfreeing‚Äô move forms a mill, it doesn‚Äôt count. In this
situation, traditionally the blocked player says [jid i sii aan jar
aheyn]{lang="so"} ‚Äògive me a way without cutting‚Äô.

There is no ‚Äòflying‚Äô rule.
