[Kōnane]{lang="haw" .game-title id="index-konane"} (sometimes also called
[mū]{lang="haw"}, which is also used to refer to draughts) is a traditional
Hawaiian abstract game for two players. While it looks similar to checkers at
first glance, the object of the game is different, and the strategy is very
deep.

## History


[Kōnane]{lang="haw"} stands alone as a purely-abstract game in Hawaiian
culture.^[John F. G. Stokes (1875–1960, an Australian archæologist on Hawaii)
suggested—with only a sliver of linguistic evidence—that it could be a distant
descendant of Go, which had been transmitted by the survivors of Japanese
shipwrecks [@Stokes] .] However, it definitely existed before European contact,
as it was described by Captain Cook’s voyage, which was the first to reach the
islands (see below).

The game dates at least from the early 18th century, as it was played by
Kahekili II (c. 1737–1794), who was high chief ([aliʻi nui]{lang="haw"}) of
Maui. Kahekili and his advisers possibly used the board, or at least the pieces,
to plan battles:

> [T]here was no other king so genuinely accomplished in making war as King
> Kahekili of Maui and the actions on the battlefield plainly showed his
> knowledge of the checkers game of war. […] It was also said that
> at the house of Kahekili the heaps of little stones were maneuvered for battle
> strategy so that his generals need only fulfill their movements.
> [@KamehamehaAndHisWarrior, p. 41]

> Not only were [the old [kāhuna]{lang="haw"} of this land] seers, but some of
> them used the [papa kōnane hoʻoneʻe ʻiliʻili]{lang="haw"}
> [[kōnane]{lang="haw"} stones] to guide them in understanding the movements on
> the battlefield. [@KamehamehaAndHisWarrior, p. 123]

The gods were also rumoured to enjoy [kōnane]{lang="haw"}: the volcano goddess
[Pele]{lang="haw" .proper-noun} was said to play it at her home in
[Hale-maʻumaʻu]{lang="haw" .proper-noun} crater [@Ellis17, p. 183].

The earliest written record we have of the game is from James King, who was an
officer that sailed on board Captain Cook’s third voyage to the Pacific.^[At the
time of the entry quoted, Captain Cook himself had been killed. Upon returning
to England, James King was the one who completed the official account of the
voyage.] In an entry dated March 1779, he wrote:

> It is very remarkable, that the people of theſe iſlands are great gamblers.
> They have a game very much like our draughts; but, if one may judge from the
> number of ſquares, it is much more intricate. The board is about two feet
> long, and it is divided into two hundred and thirty-eight ſquares, of which
> there are fourteen in a row, and they make uſe of black and white pebbles,
> which they move from ſquare to ſquare. [@VoyageToPacific, p. 144]

Another early witness was Archibald Campbell, a Scottish sailor who visited
Oʻahu from 1809–1810.^[Campbell arrived aboard the *Neva*, the first Russian
ship to circumnavigate the world, on the 29th of January 1809, and left aboard
the *Duke of Portland*, a whaler, on the 4th of March 1810. The *Duke of
Portland* also carried a letter from King Kamehameha to King George III, see
@Hackler86. More information about the ships is available in @Jackson92.] In his
book, he described the game:

> They have a game somewhat resembling draughts, but more complicated. It is
> played upon a board about twenty-two inches by fourteen, painted black, with
> white spots, on which the men are placed; these consist of black and white
> pebbles, eighteen upon each side, and the game is won by the capture of the
> adversary’s pieces.
>
> Tamaahmaah [King Kamehameha I, rumoured to be the son of Kahekili II] excels
> at this game. I have seen him sit for hours playing with his chiefs, giving an
> occasional smile, but without uttering a word. I could not play, but William
> Moxely [Campbell’s interpreter], who understood it well, told me that he had
> seen none who could beat the king.
>
> The game of draughts is now introduced, and the natives play it uncommonly
> well. [@AVoyageRoundTheWorld, p. 145]

The area around where Kamehameha lived was called Kou, and was famous as being
a location for playing [kōnane]{lang="haw"} [@LegendsOfHonolulu, p. 8]. A large
stone [kōnane]{lang="haw"} board was reported to be opposite the temple (marked
“Hale o Lono” in the map below), in the current location of the Hawaii Community
Foundation.^[@LegendsOfHonolulu [p. 8] indicates that the site was the
“Spreckels Building”, which was on Fort Street between Merchant St and Queen
St.] Smaller boards were near what is now Iolani Palace.^[Specifically,
@LegendsOfHonolulu [p. 4] states that they were near Kekūanāoʻa’s house, which
was on the corner of King and Richards Streets.]

Kamehameha lived in the large compound on the point at the bottom centre. Kou is
the area around there, bordered by the yam field at the top. Archibald Campbell
stayed for some time with Isaac Davis, who lived in the rightmost of the three
houses on the left. (Map from the [University of
Hawaiʻi](https://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/savedmaps/Pages/viewtext.php?s=browse&tid=61&route=browseby.php&by=newest).)

The game continued to be popular throughout the 19th century; William Brigham
(first director of Hawaii’s state museum) reported that King Kalākaua
(1836–1891) and his wife Queen Kapiʻolani (1834–1899) were “experts at konane”
[@Brigham08, p. 378].

In current times, it is a popular game during the Makahiki (new year) festival
[@MolokaiDispatch].

## Equipment

### The board

The board ([papakōnane]{lang="haw"} or [papamū]{lang="haw"}) is a square or
rectangular grid of pits ([lua]{lang="haw"}). Traditionally, boards were carved
out of wood and raised slightly off the ground for ease of play, or were made by
scraping holes into a slab of volcanic rock. Games could also be played on the
squares of a woven [lauhala]{lang="haw"} mat [@Emory24, p. 85].

Stone boards can be found all over the islands of Hawaii. Peter Faris’ ‘Rock Art
Blog’ has [pictures of several of these boards](https://rockartblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/hawaiian-rock-art-konane-game-boards.html).

Traditional wooden boards are now hard to find. An image of a traditional carved
board from [Iolani]{lang="haw" .proper-noun} Palace can be seen in [this Hawaiʻi
Magazine
article](https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/content/see-iolani-palaces-hidden-relics-once-belonged-hawaiian-royalty).
Wooden boards sometimes had a human molar inset in the central hole
([piko]{lang="haw"}, ‘navel’), or in some cases in all the holes of the board
[@PeterBuck]. In November 2017, an antique wooden board with shell inlay [sold
at
auction](https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=6105340&lid=1)
for €150&thinsp;000.

Historical board sizes vary greatly, and there is no standard size. King’s
account implies a board of 14×17 squares, while Campbell’s account implies a 6×6
board. An archæological survey on the island of Lanai [@Emory24, p. 84] found 14
boards, with sizes ranging from 8×8 to 13×20.^[The complete list of sizes found
was: 8×8, 8×11, 8×13, 9×10 (2 boards), 9×13 (2), 10×10, 11×11, 11×13, 13×13,
13×15, 13×20, and 15×15.] Peter Buck shows two 12×15 boards from the Bishop
Museum [@PeterBuck].^[One of these is also shown by Culin [@CulinHawaiian].]

Peter Buck also describes another board in the Bishop Museum which has 10 rows
that alternate in length between 6 & 7 holes [@PeterBuck]. This seems to be the
same board described by Emory, where the pits are set quincuncially
[@Emory24, p. 84]. This is probably not a board for playing
[kōnane]{lang="haw"}, but for playing a game similar to [damas]{lang="es"}
(‘Spanish draughts’), which is known in Hawaii as [mū]{lang="haw"}. However, it
could also be used to play [kōnane]{lang="haw"} by playing the game on the
diagonal.

### The pieces

The game is played with black & white pebbles ([ʻiliʻili]{lang="haw"}); often
the black pieces ([ʻiliʻili ʻeloʻelo]{lang="haw"}) were basalt and the white
pieces ([ʻiliʻili keʻokeʻo]{lang="haw"} or [kea]{lang="haw"}) made of branch
coral [@Ellis17, p. 159]. One [wahi pana]{lang="haw"} (celebrated location) for
stones was Kōloa, a beach situated between Nīnole and Punaluʻu in Kaʻū on
Hawaiʻi [@Ellis17, p. 258]. Unfortunately most of this beach has been stripped
of its stones for commercial purposes [@ClarkBeaches, p. 62].^[Kōloa was also
famous for its reproducing stones ([ʻiliʻili hānau]{lang="haw"}). For more about
these, see @ClarkBeaches [p. 62] or @MajesticKau [p. 33].]

### Acquiring a set

Commercially produced boards are readily available in Hawaii or online. They are
often wooden, with black & white glass pieces. You could also play the game on
a beach, using rocks & shells.

## Play

The board is set up by filling it with black and white pieces in a checkerboard
pattern.

url"}, [![Creative

To begin, the first player removes a piece from the centre of the board (or one
of the squares adjacent to that, on an even-sized board), or from any corner.
The second player removes a piece adjacent to the first, and play commences with
each player moving the pieces of the colour that they removed.

On their turn, a player must move a single piece by jumping it over an
orthogonally-adjacent enemy piece into an empty hole, thereby capturing the
enemy piece and removing it from the board. A piece may also make multiple
captures in the same direction by jumping multiple times – this is called
[kāholo]{lang="haw"}, ‘to move quickly’.

The first player that cannot move any piece on their turn loses; draws are not
possible.
