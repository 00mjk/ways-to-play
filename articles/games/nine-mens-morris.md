[Nine Men’s Morris]{.game-title id="index-nine-mens-morris"} is an ancient game.

@MerylsBoardEnigma [p. 330] collects nearly 1000 examples of the mill board
inscribed, worldwide.

For terminology, see the [mill games](/families/mill-games.html) article.

## Play

The game (as most mill games) is split into two phases. During the first
(placement) phase, the players take turns placing a single piece at a time onto
one of the vacant points on the board. Once all the pieces have been placed, the
movement phase begins. In this part of the game, players take turns moving
a single piece along a line to another vacant point. Once a player is reduced to
three pieces, their pieces can ‘fly’ and move to any empty point on the board.

Throughout the game, each time a player forms a mill they remove any piece of
their opponent’s that is not part of a mill. If all their opponent’s pieces are
in mills, no piece may be removed.

During the movement phase, it is possible to form two mills simultaneously. In
this case the player may remove two of the opponent’s pieces from the board.

A player loses the game when they are reduced to fewer than three pieces, or if
they are unable to make a valid move on their turn.

The game dates from at least the Byzantine period, and at the moment we do not
have evidence for an earlier date [@GamesGreekAndRoman, p. 3].^[@RamatHanadiv
[p. 227] describes a board found in a Byzantine villa in [חורבת עקב]{lang="he"}
([Ḥorvat ʿAqav]{lang="he-Latn" .proper-noun}), dated 500–700&nbsp;CE.] Earlier
dates have often been proposed based upon the existence of boards carved on
ancient monuments such as the Ramesseum [@AncientEgyptiansAtPlay, p. 144] and
the Mortuary Temple of Seti I at Qurna [@AncientCeylon, p. 644], but these are
not able to be dated definitively—the monument only provides an _earliest
possible_ date.

A double-sided game board with a Nine Men’s Morris layout on one side was
discovered as part of the 9th-century [Gokstad Viking ship
burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gokstad_ship) discovered in Norway.

Later on, it can be traced in English history through
[visitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_visitation) records; one
instance from Bitteswell in 1634 records that a certain Robert Lord the Younger
was “admonished and dismissed” for “playing at nine men’s morris in the
churchyard on Sunday” [@MetropoliticalVisitation, p. 497].

## Variants

### With Dice

Alfonso X’s book of games [@AlfonsoGames] describes a variant played with dice.
While it is unclear from the manuscript what the exact rules are, there are two
suggested versions:

### Lasker Morris

This variant was developed by [Emanuel Lasker]{lang="de" .proper-noun}, who was
World Chess Champion from 1894 to 1921. It unifies the two phases of the game
into one.

Play is as above, except that each player has 10 pieces instead of 9, and on
a player’s turn they may *either* place a new piece or move a piece that is
already on the board.

With perfect play the game is a draw [@SolvingLaskerMorris].

### Trencho

Trencho was a variant published by Chad Valley in 1916 that was billed as “An
Australian War-Game as Played in the Camps & Trenches”.

<figure class="side-image-r"><img src="/images/trencho.svg"
/><figcaption>Trencho is played on a modified large mill board. The game was
published with two different configurations.</figcaption></figure>

Trencho is played on a modified mill board where only two shortened diagonals
are present. Mills are called “trenches”.

The game is played as usual except:

* Upon forming a trench, a player may either remove an opponent’s piece or
  restore one of their own. If they replace a piece it may not complete
  a trench. 

* A trench may not be formed again in the same position by the same three
  pieces.
