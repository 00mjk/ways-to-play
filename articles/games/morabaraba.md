[Morabaraba]{lang="st" .proper-noun .game-title id="index-morabaraba"} is
a [mill game](/families/mill-games.html) from south-eastern Africa. The gameplay
of the standardized version is very similar to [Twelve Men’s
Morris](/games/twelve-mens-morris.html){.game-title} (with a few minor
differences), but the version played in Lesotho has a unique board.

[Morabaraba]{lang="st" .proper-noun .game-title} is played as a competitive
sport in South Africa, administered by [Mind Sports South
Africa](http://mindsportsa.co.za/). It is widely played throughout the country;
a poll conducted by <cite>The Sowetan</cite> in 1996 indicated that 40% of South
Africans played the game [@MorabarabaGetOnBoard].

Surprisingly, we know precisely who imported the game from Europe
[@MkeleMorabaraba, 134; @FromBearnToSouthernAfrica, p. 79]: it was introduced to
Lesotho—then called Basutoland—some time between 1832 and 1855 by Eugène Casalis
(or Cazalis), a French protestant missionary. ^[Upon his return to France he
wrote about his experiences in <cite lang="fr">Les Bassoutos: Vingt-Trois Années
de Séjour et D’Observations au Sud de L’Afrique</cite> (Paris, 1859) (later
published in English as <cite>The Basutos: or Twenty-Three Years in South
Africa</cite> (London: Nisbet, 1861)), but the book contains no mention of any
board games. There is now [a roundabout](https://goo.gl/maps/jymZMMft3fB2) in
his home town, [Orthez]{lang="fr" .proper-noun}, [named after
him](http://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/2013/02/16/un-nom-pour-les-ronds-points-la-gare-routiere-et-la-rocade,1118172.php).]
The introduction of the game had unintended consequences for the mission: young
men preferred to play the game rather than attend mass
[@FromBearnToSouthernAfrica, 79]. Obsession with the game also led herders to
neglect their flocks [@FromBearnToSouthernAfrica, 79], so it is known by
the epithet ‘morabaraba-that-betrays-herdboys’: “for when you play it, old or
young, you forget your herds, and they wander into the corn...”
[@TheWorldAndCattle, 56].

The name [morabaraba]{lang="st"} comes from the seSotho language, and is related to the verb [ho raba
raba]{lang="st"} ‘to roam/fly about in small circles’, as of a bird around its nest
[@SeSothoDictionary, p. 304]. In Nguni languages (isiZulu, isiXhosa), it is
known as [(Um)labalaba]{lang="zu" .proper-noun}, with similar meaning
[@GamesBasotho, p. 247–250], and in Ronga, spoken in Mozambique, it is called
[Muravarava]{lang="rng" .proper-noun}.

There are other names which are probably derived from the European name of
‘mill’ [@MkeleMorabaraba, 134]: an alternate seSotho name is [mmila]{lang="st"},
‘road’ [@UsingGamesToPromote, 283]. In Botswana, the game is called
[mhele]{lang="tn"} (‘reedbuck’, a type of antelope [@OldTswana, 350]), and the
name [morabaraba]{lang="tn"} refers solely to a mancala game.

A distinctive feature of this game is its bovine theme: in each language, the
pieces are called ‘cows’. In seSotho this is
[dikgomo]{lang="st"}/[likhomo]{lang="st"} (singular
[kgomo]{lang="st"}/[khomo]{lang="st"}) [@UseOfMorabara, p. 588]; in isiZulu it
is [izinkomo]{lang="zu"} (singular [inkomo]{lang="zu"}). Forming a mill (‘gun’)
allows you to “shoot” an opponent’s cow.

## Play

The following description is based on Mind Sports South Africa’s “Generally
Accepted Rules”. As with all traditional board games, local rules can vary.

<figure class="side-image-r"><img src="/images/large_merels_with_diagonals.svg"
/> <figcaption>Standard [Morabaraba]{lang="st" .game-title} is played on the
large mill board with diagonals.</figcaption></figure>

Each player has 12 pieces. Commonly, plastic or metal bottle caps are used in two
contrasting colours.^[This is so common that even [commercial sets use bottle
caps](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMBbRAzBg1z/), and it shows up in
[computerized versions](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf-isgxnIPF/) as a skeuomorphic feature.]

During the placement phase, players must place a single piece on any vacant
point of the board. Once all their pieces are placed, players can move a single
piece from to another vacant point, along one of the lines.

If a player places or moves a piece to form a new mill, they remove one of the
opponent’s pieces. The removed piece may not be from a mill unless there are no
other pieces that can be removed.

During the placement phase it is possible to form two mills at once. In
[Morabaraba]{lang="st" .game-title} this only allows a player to remove one
piece.

When a player is reduced to three pieces, their pieces can ‘fly’ and move to any
vacant point on the board, ignoring the lines.

A player loses the game when they are reduced to fewer than three pieces, or if
they are unable to make a valid move on their turn.


In tournament play, Mind Sports adopted an additional rule: During the movement
phase, a piece that is moved from one mill to form another mill may not move
back to form a mill again at the original point on the next turn. Instead,
a different move must be taken before doing so. This rule prevents a player from
moving backwards and forwards between two mills quickly. This rule seems to me
to be unlikely to be used in casual play.

## Variants

### Sotho version

<figure class="side-image-r"><img
src="/images/large_merels_with_diagonals_and_centre.svg" /> <figcaption>The
Sotho version of the game is played on a board with a central
cross.</figcaption></figure>

The Sotho version of the game is played on a special board where the centre
square is also crossed, and the inner diagonals are missing, giving 25 points
that can be played on [@IndigenousGamesRuleBook; @MkeleMorabaraba, p. 133]. This means that there is no
possibility of a deadlock after the placement phase.

Some rulesets (e.g. @BlacUmlabalaba) state that a piece on the central point can
only be the middle piece of a mill. Other lines of three formed with the central
point do not count as mills.

Note that it is not possible to form a diagonal mill on this board.

### Alternate board

Another board pattern is also used to play [Morabaraba]{lang="st" .game-title},
with a diagonally crossed central square. I do not know if the rules vary
in any way.
