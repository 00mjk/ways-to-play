[Three Men’s Morris]{.game-title id="index-three-mens-morris"} is an ancient
game for 2 players.

## Terminology

It was known in the past by many names in England. Some of them include
‘knockings in and out’ [@NotesOnTheAbbey, p. 20; @OnTheIndoorGamesOfSchoolBoys,
p. 321].

Murray [@Murray2] claims that a distinct game called ‘Nine Holes’ existed, but
I don’t believe that it was separate to Three Men’s Morris, as all the
references seem to track back to a single entry in Robert Nares’
<cite>Glossary</cite> [@NaresGlossary, p. 345].

Writing in 1694,[@Hyde] Hyde said it (or the variant where 3 pieces line up on
each side to begin with) was called “Che-Lo” in Chinese (i.e. [直六]{lang="zh"}
[zhí liù]{lang="zh-Latn"} ‘straight six’^[Although he gives a corrupted
character that looks more like [有]{lang="zh"}]), “Hugjurè” in Persian (probably
[هجوره]{lang="fa"} “his majesty”, but he also said that each player has
6 pieces), “cashlan gherra” in Irish (i.e. [caisleáin gearr]{lang="ga"} ‘short
castle’), and “Copped-Crown” in Cumbria & Westmorland.


In other parts of the world, it is known as Tapatan in the Philippines, or
[六卒棋]{lang="yue-Hans-HK"} ([luk<sup>6</sup> zeot<sup>1</sup>
kei<sup>4</sup>]{lang="yue-Latn-HK-jyutping"} ‘six man game’) in southern China
[@CulinPhilippine, p. 648].^[Note that @Bell confuses his sources here and
claims that @Hyde states that “Luk Tsut K’i” was played in the time of
Confucius.]

Ref: [@OxfordBG; @Bell, p. 91; @Murray2, §3.3, p. 41]

To write up: Tapatan, Achi, Picaria.

See also: Picaria in [@Zaslavsky; @TicTacToe].


Also called corsicrown in Scotland [@Gallovidian, 142], played on a grid instead
of on the lines. 

Also called (with diagonals) Hopscotch, in @MathematicalRecreationsMaurice [p.
267], but that name is better reserved for Picaria.

## Variants

### [Circular Three Men’s Morris]{.game-title id="index-circular-three-mens-morris"}

See [@HeimannLoop]. @Zaslavsky [p. 4–5] calls it
‘[Shisima]{id="index-shisima"}’, and says it is played in Kenya.^[The original
reference for this seems to be <cite>African Games of Strategy: A teaching
manual</cite> by Louise Crane, but I haven’t been able to view this work.] It
has also been published as ‘Tri-Pin’ by Louis Marx & Co., Swansea, UK.

### X-ceter-O

[X-ceter-O][] (or [X-für-O]{lang="de"} in Germany) has 6 pieces numbered #1–#6,
alternating between sides. The pieces must be placed or moved in order (and can
leap to any unoccupied square), looping back to #1 after #6 has been moved.

### King

[King][] (Jim Wilkinson, 1985, Paradigm Games). A commercial implementation. No
first play to centre, and pieces may move on the long diagonals.

### Chung Toi

[Chung Toi][] (Reginald Chung, 1994, multiple publishers).

Each player’s pieces are octagonal, and have a cross incised upon the top. After
the placement phase, a piece can move one or two squares (jumping is allowed)
in any of the four directions that the cross is pointing, and may also rotate.
A piece may also rotate without moving instead.
