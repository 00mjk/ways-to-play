<ruby lang="ja">手<rt lang="ja-Latn">te</rt>本<rt lang="ja-Latn">hon</rt>引<rt
lang="ja-Latn">bi</rt>き<rt lang="ja-Latn">ki</rt></ruby> (translation is
something like ‘draw an example’) is a Japanese gambling game. It is usually
played with three special sets of cards:

* Cards for each player, numbered 1–6. These are called <ruby lang="ja">張札<rt
  lang="ja-Latn">harifuda</rt></ruby>, <ruby lang="ja">書札<rt
  lang="ja-Latn">kakifuda</rt></ruby>, or <ruby lang="ja">大一六<rt
  lang="ja-Latn">dai ichi roku</rt></ruby>. There are two styles;
  the Ōsaka style has the odd numbers in red, whereas with the Kyoto style all
  the numbers are black.
* Cards for the dealer, again numbered 1–6, but in a different pattern. These
  are called <ruby lang="ja">繰札<rt lang="ja-Latn">kurifuda</rt></ruby>, <ruby
  lang="ja">親札<rt lang="ja-Latn">oyafuda</rt></ruby> ‘house cards’, or <ruby
  lang="ja">引札<rt lang="ja-Latn">hikifuda</rt></ruby>. The card with the
  number 4 on it is also stamped with the manufacturer’s mark.
* Wooden blocks numbered 1–6 for the dealer to show recently chosen numbers.
  These are called <ruby lang="ja">目木<rt lang="ja-Latn">meki</rt></ruby>.

The 1968 Japanese film <i>Red Peony Gambler</i> <ruby lang="ja">緋牡丹<rt
lang="ja-Latn">hibotan</rt>博徒<rt lang="ja-Latn">bakuto</rt></ruby> (also
titled in English ‘Lady Yakuza: The Red Peony Gambler’) opens with a scene in
which the game is played. (The film can be viewed [on The Internet
Archive](https://archive.org/details/LadyYakuzaTheRedPeonyGambler).) 

## Equipment variations

When played with [Mah Jong](/equipment/mah-jong.html) tiles, it is called <ruby
lang="ja">牌本引<rt lang="ja-Latn">haihonbiki</rt></ruby>.

Tehonbiki can also be played with [Hanafuda](/equipment/hanafuda.html) cards. In
this case it is called <ruby lang="ja">絵本引<rt
lang="ja-Latn">ehonbiki</rt></ruby>. When used in this manner, the values of the
cards are ignored and only the months are considered; the mapping of months to
numbers is:

1. Pine (January) or bush clover (July)
2. Rain (November) or silver grass (August)
3. Cherry (March) or chrysanthemum (September)
4. Wisteria (April) or maple (October)
5. Iris (May) or peony (June)
6. Paulownia (December) or plum (February)

When playing with Hanafuda, the ‘eyes’ (mefuda TODO) are not used, and
instead the past outcomes are recorded on a piece of paper.

Tehonbiki can also be played with dice (TODO).
