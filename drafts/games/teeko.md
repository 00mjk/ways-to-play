[Teeko]{.game-title} is a game for 2 players by [John
Scarne](/people/john-scarne.html).

## History

Teeko was developed over a period of 15 years by John Scarne [@Teeko]. He
believed that it was a game to rival chess and checkers, and that it would
eventually rank alongside (or above) them. Nowadays it is barely known.

## Play

## Analysis

Solving Teeko was suggested as Item 90 in the “HAKMEM” memo [@HAKMEM]. Guy
Steele proved that the basic game is a draw if played perfectly, and that the
advanced game is a first-player win [@SteeleTeeko].
