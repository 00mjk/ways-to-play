# Horseshoe

This is a simple children’s game that seems to originate from China, where it is
known by many names. Because the board is shaped like the Chinese character ‘区’
(‘area’), it is known as ‘area character game’ [区字棋]{lang="zh"}. Other names
include ‘crotch game’ [裤裆棋]{lang="zh"}, or ‘scissor game’
[剪刀棋]{lang="zh"}. (TODO: transliterations!)

In Cantonese it is called <ruby lang="yue-Hans-HK">䦁口棋<rt
lang="yue-Latn-HK-jyutping">bong<sup>1</sup> hau<sup>2</sup>
kei<sup>4</sup></rt></ruby>,^[In older books (such as Culin’s) this is
transliterated as “pong hau k’i”.] which means ‘mattock blade chess’. An
equivalent Mandarin term is <ruby lang="zh">鋤<rt lang="zh-Latn">chú</rt>棋<rt
lang="zh-Latn">qi</rt></ruby> ‘hoe chess’.

In Korea it is known as <ruby lang="ko">우물고누<rt
lang="ko-Latn">umulgonu</rt></ruby> ‘well game’ or <ruby lang="ko">강고누<rt
lang="ko-Latn">ganggonu</rt></ruby> ‘river game’ [@KoreanGames, p. 100]. In
Punjabi it is called [dō-guṭi]{lang="pa-Latn"} (TODO: possibly
[ਦੋਗੁਟਿ]{lang="pa"}?) [@GuptaD, p. 143].
