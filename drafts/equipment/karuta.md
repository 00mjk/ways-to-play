playing cards, derived from the Portuguese word for playing cards,
[carta]{lang="pt"}.

After being introduced by Portuguese sailors and merchants in the late 16th
century [@DragonsOfPortugal], playing cards in Japan underwent a long period of
speciation due to the isolationist [sakoku]{lang="ja-Latn"} ([鎖国]{lang="ja"},
‘closed country’) policy of the [Tokugawa]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}
shōgunate which severely limited contact with the outside world for over 200
years.

Cut off from their original source, Portuguese playing cards were developed in
new and surprising ways. Decks were increased in complexity by adding more ranks
or additional suits. Later on, new variants were introduced to circumvent
anti-gambling laws, to obscure the true nature of the cards as gambling
implements, or to simplify existing decks by removing suits or ranks.

## Portuguese-derived cards

### [Tenshō Karuta]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} [天正かるた]{lang="ja"}

This is the earliest known native Japanese deck, appearing during the
[Tenshō]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} period (1573–1592). It recreates precisely
the Portuguese decks of the period, retaining the imagery and composition of the
originals.

In 1597 there is a reference in the records of the Chōsokabe family
([長宗我部氏]{lang="ja"}) that describes soldiers playing with cards
[@DragonsOfPortugal, p. 43].

In 1636 the Portuguese were excluded from mainland Japan and in 1639 they were
expelled from the country entirely. [Tenshō]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} cards
were made illegal in 1648 [@DragonsOfPortugal, p. 46].

### [Unsun Karuta]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} ([うんすんかるた]{lang="ja"}) & [Sunkun Karuta]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} ([すんくんかるた]{lang="ja"})

The Unsun Karuta becomes much more Japanese. It adds three new ranks, and a new suit.

Sunkun adds another rank and suit, and one additional card.

Both types of card were banned in the 1790s.

### [Mekuri Karuta]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}

Descended from Tenshō Karuta, making the designs more Japanese, and more
obscure.

### [Kabufuda]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}

Simplifies Mekuri Karuta by replacing all suits with a single suit.

### [Hanafuda]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}
