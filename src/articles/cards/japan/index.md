Japan developed many different kinds of cards, in isolation from most of the
rest of the world. There are two main families of cards, and a third probably
derived from both of these:

* Cards derived from Portuguese patterns, with suits and ranks. In order of
  appearance these are:
    * <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Tenshō Karuta</Noun> (<span lang="ja">天正カルタ
      </span>, ‘<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Tenshō</Noun> cards’)
    * <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Unsun Karuta</Noun> (<span lang="ja">うんすんかるた
      </span>, ‘<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Un-Sun</Noun> cards’)
    * <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Sunkun Karuta</Noun> (<span lang="ja">すんくんかるた
      </span>, ‘<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Sun-Kun</Noun> cards’)
    * <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Mekuri Karuta</Noun> (<span lang="ja">捲りかるた
      </span>, ‘turning cards’) were an alteration of the <Noun
      lang="ja-Latn">Tenshō</Noun> pattern cards, probably to evade bans on
      those cards. The structure of the deck remains the same, but there are
      many different regional artwork patterns.
    * [<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kabu
      Karuta</Noun>](/articles/cards/japan/kabu-karuta/) (<span lang="ja">株かる
      た</span>) were a further simplification of <span
      lang="ja-Latn">mekuri</span> cards, eliminating all suits except for one,
      which is replicated four times. Like <span lang="ja-Latn">mekuri</span>
      cards, there are many regional varieties, but <span
      lang="ja-Latn">kabufuda</span> is the only one still in mass production.
* Cards used for simpler matching games, not organized into suits or ranks:
    * <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Uta-garuta</Noun> (<span lang="ja">歌かるた</span>,
      ‘poetry cards’)
    * <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Iroha-garuta</Noun> (<span lang="ja">いろはかるた
      </span>, ‘alphabet cards’)
* [<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>](/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/) (<span
  lang="ja">花札</span>, ‘flower cards’) are derived from a combination of both
  the Portuguese and the matching-type cards.
