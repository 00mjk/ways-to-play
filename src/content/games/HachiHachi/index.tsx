        <p><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hachi-Hachi</Noun> (<span lang="ja">八八</span>, ‘88’) is the preëminent <a href="/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun></a> gambling game. In many old English sources it is considered synonymous with ‘<Noun lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</Noun>’ or ‘<Noun lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</Noun>’ and isn’t given a more specific name.</p>
        <p>The name derives from the objective of the game; the standard version of the game is for three active players, and there are 264 total card points available, so the goal for each player is to obtain at least their share, i.e. 264 ÷ 3 = <strong>88</strong> points.</p>
        <p>Despite being — historically, at least —  the most important <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> game, it is also one of the most difficult. The play of the cards is the same as in other <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> games, but the procedures of betting and payment combine to increase the complexity. There are also multiple sets of <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span>, and specialized equipment that was commonly used with the game.</p>
        {/*
    <p>Because of this, I present a simplified base game first, and each subsequent section introduces another extension of the rules until the full version of the game is attained.<Footnote>This approach was inspired by Z.D. Smith’s “<a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/posts/a-curriculum-of-vira.html">A Curriculum of Vira</a>”.</Footnote> As a game that was often played in secret for money, there is no one ‘true’ set of rules, and there are also many optional variations and regional rules differences.</p>

                <p><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kashifuda</Noun> are cards that are used to stand in for money, since playing gambling games for real money has almost always been illegal in Japan. The name means ‘sweets cards’, but is also a pun on <span lang="ja">貸し</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kashi</span> (‘debt/favour’), so can be understood as ‘debt cards’. I think the name was originally probably meant to be the latter but was later modified into the current form. In any case, the cards usually show pictures of food and drink.</p>
                <p>It is unclear how literally the images should be taken — did a card depicting a steak dinner require the loser to make payment in kind? It is fun to imagine so, but I have no evidence to support this.</p>
