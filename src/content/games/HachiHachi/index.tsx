    <p><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hachi-Hachi</Noun> (<span lang="ja">八八</span>, ‘88’) is the preëminent <a href="/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun></a> gambling game. In many old English sources it is considered synonymous with ‘<Noun lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</Noun>’ or ‘<Noun lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</Noun>’ and isn’t given a more specific name.</p>
    <p>The name derives from the objective of the game; the standard version of the game is for three active players, and there are 264 total card points available, so the goal for each player is to obtain at least 264 ÷ 3 = <strong>88</strong> points.</p>
    <p>Despite being the most important <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> gambling game, it is also one the most difficult. The play of the cards is the same as in other <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> games, but the procedures of betting and payment combine to increase the complexity. There are also multiple sets of <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span>, and specialized equipment that was commonly used with the game.</p>
