  <Description><span id="index-nine-mens-morris" className="game-title">Nine Men’s Morris</span> is an ancient <a href="/articles/mill-games">mill game</a>, dating at least from Roman times. It is the most prominent of all the mill games, played all around the world, but particularly in central European countries. Other variations of the game — such as Shax or <GameRef id="morabaraba" /> — are also played in several African countries.</Description>
  <p>In addition to being a game, the board was used as some kind of talisman or symbol; <Cite r="MerylsBoardEnigma" inline page={330} /> collects nearly a thousand examples of inscribed mill boards from around the world. Many of these are in vertical positions on walls where they could not possibly have been used for games, and their purpose is at the moment not well understood.</p>

      Nine Men’s Morris is played on the large mill board.

    <p>The game (as most mill games) is split into two phases. During the first (placement) phase, the players take turns placing a single piece at a time onto one of the vacant points on the board. Once all the pieces have been placed, the movement phase begins. In this part of the game, players take turns moving a single piece along a line to another vacant point. Once a player is reduced to three pieces, their pieces can ‘fly’ and move to any empty point on the board. </p>
    <p>Throughout the game, each time a player forms a mill they remove any piece of their opponent’s that is not part of a mill. If all their opponent’s pieces are in mills, no piece may be removed.</p>
    <p>During the movement phase, it is possible to form two mills simultaneously. In this case the player may remove two of the opponent’s pieces from the board.</p>
    <p>A player loses the game when they are reduced to fewer than three pieces, or if they are unable to make a valid move on their turn.</p>

    <p>The game dates from at least the late Roman Empire or Byzantine period, and at the moment we do not have evidence for an earlier date.<Cite r="GamesGreekAndRoman" page={3} /><Footnote><Cite r="RamatHanadiv" page={227} inline /> describes a board found in a Byzantine villa in <span lang="he">חורבת עקב</span> (<Noun lang="he-Latn">Ḥorvat ʿAqav</Noun>), dated 400–600&nbsp;CE, while a cache of gaming boards found in a Roman fort at <Noun lang="ar-Latn">Abu Sha’ar</Noun> that was abandoned in the late 4th century contained no mills boards.<Cite r="RomanGameBoards" /></Footnote> Earlier dates have often been proposed based upon the existence of boards carved on ancient monuments such as the Ramesseum<Cite r="AncientEgyptiansAtPlay" page={144} /> and the Mortuary Temple of Seti I at Qurna,<Cite r="AncientCeylon" page={644} /> but these are not able to be dated definitively—the monument only provides an <em>earliest possible</em> date.</p>
    <p>The game spread throughout Europe quickly: a double-sided game board with a Nine Men’s Morris layout on one side was found as part of the 9th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gokstad_ship">Gokstad Viking ship burial</a> discovered in Norway.<Cite r="TheVikingShipFromGokstad" page={[44, 99]} /></p>
    <p>One of the earliest written references to the game is in the 10th century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitab_al-Aghani"><cite lang="ar-Latn">Kitāb al-Aghānī</cite></a> (<cite lang="ar"><Isolate>كتاب الأغاني</Isolate></cite>, ‘book of songs’), a large collection of poems and stories assembled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Faraj_al-Isfahani"><Noun lang="ar-Latn">ʾAbū l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī</Noun></a> (<Isolate><span lang="ar">أبو الفرج الأصفهاني</span></Isolate>, 897–967). One story describes a club from the time of the poet <Noun lang="ar-Latn">al-Aḥwaṣ</Noun> (<Isolate><span lang="ar">الأحوص</span></Isolate>, 660–724), along with the board games it held for the use of its members. According to the book, they could play <span lang="ar-Latn">shiṭranj</span> (<Isolate><span lang="ar">شطرنج</span></Isolate>, chess), <span lang="ar-Latn">nard</span> (<span lang="ar">نرد</span>), or — most importantly here — <span lang="ar-Latn">qirq</span> (<Isolate><span lang="ar">قرق</span></Isolate>, morris).<Cite r="GamblingInIslam" page={481} /> The derivation of the name <span lang="ar-Latn">qirq</span> is uncertain, but it is apparently not originally an Arabic word.<Cite r="Murray2" page={37} />
    <Footnote>The Imam <Noun lang="ar-Latn">ʾAbū al-Qāsim al-Rāfiʿī al-Qazwīnī</Noun> (<Isolate><span lang="ar">أبو القاسم الرافعي القزويني</span></Isolate>, 1160–1226) would later describe <span lang="ar-Latn">qirq</span> as the “chess of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghrebis">Maghrebis</a>”.<Cite r="GamblingInIslam" page={381} /> Similarly, <GameRef id="shax"/> is sometimes referred to as “Somali chess”.</Footnote></p>
    <p>Later, <Noun lang="fa-Latn">Faīrūzābādī</Noun> (of whom, more below) would identify <span lang="ar-Latn">qirq</span> with <span lang="ar-Latn">suddar</span> (<span lang="ar">سُدَّر</span>), apparently derived from the Persian <span lang="fa-Latn">se darre</span> (<span lang="fa">سِهْ دَرَهْ</span>), meaning ‘three valleys’.<Cite r="Hyde" page={[[207, 209]]} /> However, in other dictionaries <span lang="ar-Latn">suddar</span> is identified with other games such as <span lang="ar-Latn">aṭ-ṭabanu</span> (<span lang="ar">الطَّبَنُ</span>), which is known as a different game today (modern name <span lang="ar-Latn">aṭ-ṭāb</span> <span lang="ar">الطاب</span>).<Cite r="LaneTab" /> It is probable that in the past, names of games were more fluid, and often referred to families of games. Even in modern Arabic the name <span lang="ar-Latn">ʾidrīs</span> (<span lang="ar">ادريس</span>) is used to refer to mill games, but also refers to loosely related games such as <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/286295/quantik">Quantik</a>. With that said, a Persian origin for the game does seem likely, given the number of ways that <span lang="ar-Latn">suddar</span> is rendered in Arabic dictionaries.<Footnote>Other versions of the name are given as <span lang="ar">سِهْ بَرَهٌ</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">sih barahun</span>), <span lang="ar">سِيدَرَهِ</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">sīdarahi</span>), <span lang="ar">سِدْرَه</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">sidrah</span>), <span lang="ar">سَذْ مَرَهْ</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">saḏ marah</span>), or <span lang="ar">سِدْ مَزْه</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">sid mazh</span>).<Cite r="LaneTab" /></Footnote></p>
    <p>From the Arabic-speaking world the game entered Spain, where <span lang="ar-Latn">al-qirq</span> became <span lang="es">alquerque</span>, which has remained the Spanish name for this family of games until the present day.</p>

      Text of the French Templar rule from an early 14th-century manuscript edition (with quoted passage highlighted).
    </ArticleImage>
    <p>In the early 12th century, the game was mentioned in the French Rule of the Templar order (probably written between 1139 and 1147&nbsp;CE<Cite r="TheRuleOfTheTemplars" page={12} />), as the only board game allowed to be played by Templar brothers. It is possible that the order picked up the game through their contact with the Arabic-speaking world:<Footnote>Indeed, a board has been found inscribed upon a stone in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_P%C3%A8lerin"><Noun lang="fr">Château Pèrelin</Noun></a>, a fortress constructed by the Templars in what is now Israel — although it could have been placed there any time since the fortress was built.<Cite r="AtlitCastle" page={60} /></Footnote></p>
    <div className="multi">
      <p lang="fr">Et sachies que a nul autre jeu frere dou Temple ne doit joer, fors qu’a marelles as queles chascun puet juer se il veaut por desduit sans metre gajeures. As eschas ni a tables nul frere dou Temple ne doit juer, ne as eschaçons.<Cite r="LaRegleDuTemple" page={185} /></p>
      <p>And let it be known that a brother of the Temple should play no other game except <span lang="fr">marelles</span>, which each may play if he wishes, for pleasure without placing wagers. No brother should play chess, backgammon, or <span lang="fr">eschaçons</span> [an unknown game].<Cite r="TheRuleOfTheTemplars" page={90} /></p>
    </div>
    <p>It is unclear <em>why</em> mill games were permitted by the Templars<Footnote>TODO: it has been suggested (?) that the tripartite board was taken as supportive of the trinity, or remniscent of the First Temple of Jerusalem.</Footnote>, but, reading the rest of the passage (not quoted above), the intent of the Rule seems to be to prevent playing games for money — bets were allowed to be placed on games, but only with worthless items such as wooden tent pegs. Viewed in this light, perhaps mill games were considered less susceptible to gambling, and therefore permissible.</p>
