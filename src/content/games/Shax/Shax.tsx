            <Pronounce word="Shax" file={pronShax} lang="so" noun pronouncer="ahmed_aw_abdi" /> is a <a href="/articles/mill-games">mill game</a> from Somalia. In central and southern regions of Somalia it is called <span lang="so">jare</span> (‚Äòcut‚Äô).<Cite r="IntroductionToShax" page={1} /> Unlike most mill games, captures cannot be made during the placement phase.
        </Description>
        <blockquote>Sometimes [the Bedouin] play at Shahh, Shantarah, and other games, of which they are passionately fond: with a board formed of lines traced in the sand, and bits of dry wood or camel‚Äôs earth acting pieces, they spend hour after hour, every looker-on vociferating his opinion, and catching at the men, till apparently the two players are those least interested in the game.<Cite r="FirstFootsteps" page={[[179, 180]]} /></blockquote>

                <p>Players take turns playing one of their pieces on a vacant point of the board.  Unlike Twelve Men‚Äôs Morris, completing a mill during this phase does not allow you to remove an opponent‚Äôs piece.</p>
                <p>Once all the pieces are on the board (and all 24 points are full), the player who first completed a mill removes one of their opponent‚Äôs pieces. If neither player completed a mill, the second player removes a piece.</p>

            <Section title="Movement phase">
                <p>Starting with the player who first completed a mill, players take turns moving one of their pieces along a line to a vacant space.</p>
                <p>Each time a player forms a mill, they may remove an opponent‚Äôs piece, and reducing the opponent to two pieces wins the game.</p>
                <p>If a player is completely blocked, the other player must make a move that allows them to move. If the ‚Äòfreeing‚Äô move forms a mill, it may not capture. In this situation, traditionally the blocked player says <span lang="so">jid i sii aan jar aheyn</span> ‚Äògive me a way without cutting‚Äô.</p>
                <p>There is no ‚Äòflying‚Äô rule.</p>
            </Section>
            <Section title="Scoring">
                <p>Scores are kept by tracking one player‚Äôs consecutive wins with stones that match their pieces, placed in the centre of the board. As soon as a winning player loses a game, any score they have accumulated is removed from the middle. A player that wins four games in a row wins a ‚Äòpool‚Äô; five in a row is a ‚Äògirl‚Äô. In the past a prospective husband would ‚Äúwin‚Äù his wife from her consenting father in this manner.<Cite r="SomaliGames" page={[[503,505]]} /></p>
