    <p><Noun lang="st">Morabaraba</Noun> is a <Link to="/articles/mill-games">mill game</Link> from south-eastern Africa. The gameplay of the standardized version is very similar to <Link to="/games/twelve-mens-morris" className="game-title">Twelve Men’s Morris</Link> (with a few minor differences), but the version played in Lesotho has a unique board.</p>
    <p><Noun lang="st">Morabaraba</Noun> is played as a competitive sport in South Africa, administered by <a href="http://mindsportsa.co.za/">Mind Sports South Africa</a>. It is widely played throughout the country; a poll conducted by <cite>The Sowetan</cite> in 1996 indicated that 40% of South Africans played the game.<Cite r={MorabarabaGetOnBoard} /></p>

      A game of <Noun lang="st">Morabaraba</Noun> being played.

    <Section title="History">
      <p>Surprisingly, unlike most board games we know who was responsible for transmitting the game from Europe:<Cite r={MkeleMorabaraba} page={134} /><Cite r={FromBearnToSouthernAfrica} page={79} /> it was introduced to Lesotho—then called Basutoland—some time between 1832 and 1855 by Eugène Casalis, a French protestant missionary who acted as Foreign Advisor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshoeshoe_I">King Moshoeshoe I</a> for nearly two decades.<Footnote>Casalis is also sometimes also referred to as Cazalis in English sources. Upon his return to France he wrote about his experiences in <cite lang="fr">Les Bassoutos: Vingt-Trois Années de Séjour et D’Observations au Sud de L’Afrique</cite> (Paris, 1859) (later published in English as <cite>The Basutos: or Twenty-Three Years in South Africa</cite> (London: Nisbet, 1861)), but the book contains no mention of any board games. There is now <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/jymZMMft3fB2">a roundabout</a> in his home town, <Noun lang="fr">Orthez</Noun>, <a href="http://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/2013/02/16/un-nom-pour-les-ronds-points-la-gare-routiere-et-la-rocade,1118172.php">named after him</a>.</Footnote> The introduction of the game had unintended consequences for the mission: young men preferred to play the game rather than attend mass.<Cite r={FromBearnToSouthernAfrica} page={79} /> Obsession with the game also led herders to neglect their flocks,<Cite r={FromBearnToSouthernAfrica} page={79} /> so it became known by the epithet <span lang="st">sethetsabadisana</span> ‘deceiver of the herd-boys’:‌<Cite r={BasothoChildren} page={41} /> “for when you play it, old or young, you forget your herds, and they wander into the corn…”‌<Cite r={TheWorldAndCattle} page={56} /></p>
      <p>The game was also popular amongst Basotho men who travelled to South Africa to work in its mines. References to <Noun lang="st">Morabaraba</Noun> can be found in <span lang="st">difela</span>/<span lang="st">lifela</span> (singular <span lang="st">sefela</span>), song–poems that were sung by these migrant workers.<Cite r={BasothoOralPoetry} page={[17, 175, 229]} /><Cite r={TimeOfCannibals} page={[[98, 101]]} /></p>
      <p>In Lesotho’s past the game was restricted to being played by men, to the point that women were not permitted in the vicinity of the gaming area.<Cite r={SesothoFarming} page={95} /> Thankfully, times are changing, and as of 2021, the top-ranked player in Mind Sports South Africa’s league is a woman, named Saudah Bhaimia, who has won the last three national championships.<Cite r={SaudahBhaimia} /> </p>

      <p>The name <span lang="st">moraba-raba</span> comes from the Sesotho language, and is related to the verb <span lang="st">ho raba raba</span> ‘to roam in small circles’,<Cite r={SeSothoDictionary} page={304} /> so could refer to the action of a mill.‌ In Nguni languages (isiZulu, isiXhosa), it is known as <Noun lang="zu">(Um)labalaba</Noun>, with similar meaning,‌<Cite r={GamesBasotho} page={[[247, 250]]} /> and in Ronga, spoken in Mozambique, it is called <Noun lang="rng">Muravarava</Noun>.</p>

      <Footnote standalone>There are two different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesotho_orthography">Sesotho orthographies</a>. In this article I give the South African one first, followed by the Lesotho.</Footnote>
      <p>There are other names which are probably derived from the European name of ‘mill’:‌<Cite r={MkeleMorabaraba} page={134} /> an alternate Sesotho name is <span lang="st">mmila</span>/<span lang="st">’mila</span>, ‘road’.‌<Cite r={UsingGamesToPromote} page={283} /> In Botswana, the game is called <span lang="tn">mhele</span> (‘reedbuck’, a type of antelope‌<Cite r={OldTswana} page={350} />), and the name <span lang="tn">morabaraba</span> refers solely to a mancala game.
      <Footnote>Because of the large overlap of names, in written descriptions <Noun lang="st">Morabaraba</Noun> is often confused with or included in lists of other mancala games, such as <span lang="ve">mefuvha</span> (from Limpopo) or <span lang="sn">tsoro</span> (from Mozambique/Zimbabwe) (see, for example, <Cite r={MorabarabaGetOnBoard} inline />).</Footnote></p>

      <p>A distinctive feature of this game is its bovine theme: in each language, the pieces are called ‘cows’. In Sesotho this is <span lang="st">dikgomo</span>/<span lang="st">likhomo</span> (singular <span lang="st">kgomo</span>/<span lang="st">khomo</span>);‌<Cite r={UseOfMorabara} page={588} /> in isiZulu it is <span lang="zu">izinkomo</span> (singular <span lang="zu">inkomo</span>). In isiZulu a mill is a <Pronounce pronouncer="Lungii" word="isibhamu" file={pronIsibhamu} lang="zu" /> (‘gun’), which allows you to “shoot” an opponent’s cow, while in Sesotho the mill is called a <span lang="st">molamu</span> (a staff carried by shepherds), and you can eat (<span lang="st">ja</span>) a cow.<Cite r={BasothoChildren} page={36} /></p>

      <p>The following description is based on Mind Sports South Africa’s “Generally Accepted Rules”. As with all traditional board games, local rules can vary.</p>
      <p>Each player has 12 pieces. Commonly, plastic or metal bottle caps<Footnote>
        The use of bottle caps is so common that even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMBbRAzBg1z/">commercial sets use bottle caps</a>, and they show up in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf-isgxnIPF/">computerized versions</a> as a skeuomorphic feature.
            </Footnote> are used in two contrasting colours.</p>

        Standard <span className="game-title" lang="st">Morabaraba</span> is played on the large mill board with diagonals.
            </ArticleImage>
      <p>During the placement phase, players must place a single piece on any vacant point of the board. Once all their pieces are placed, players can move a single piece to another vacant point, along one of the lines.</p>
      <p>If a player places or moves a piece to form a new mill, they remove one of the opponent’s pieces. The removed piece may not be from a mill unless there are no other pieces that can be removed.</p>
      <p>During the placement phase it is possible to form two mills at once. In <span className="game-title" lang="st">Morabaraba</span> this only allows a player to remove one piece.</p>
      <p>When a player is reduced to three pieces, their pieces can ‘fly’ and move to any vacant point on the board, ignoring the lines.</p>
      <p>A player loses the game when they are reduced to fewer than three pieces, or if they are unable to make a valid move on their turn.</p>
      <p>In tournament play, Mind Sports adopted an additional rule: During the movement phase, a piece that is moved from one mill to form another mill may not move back to form a mill again at the original point on the next turn. Instead, a different move must be taken before doing so. This rule prevents a player from moving backwards and forwards between two mills quickly. This rule seems to me to be unlikely to be used in casual play.</p>

        <p>The Sotho version of the game is played on a special board or flat stone (<span lang="st">letlapa</span>)<Cite r={BasothoChildren} page={35} /> where the centre square is also crossed, and the inner diagonals are missing, giving 25 points that can be played on.‌<Cite r={IndigenousGamesRuleBook} /><Cite r={MkeleMorabaraba} page={133} /> This means that there is no possibility of a deadlock after the placement phase.</p>
        <p>Some rulesets<Cite r={BlacUmlabalaba} /> state that a piece on the central point can only be the middle piece of a mill. Other lines of three formed with the central point do not count as mills.</p>
        <p>Note that it is not possible to form a diagonal mill on this board.</p>
