  <p>In this page I collect all simple staking games. These are games entirely of luck where players place bets (stakes) on a random outcome such as a dice roll.</p>
  <Section title="Crown & Anchor">
    <p>Crown & Anchor games involve simple bets on the outcome of rolling three six-sided dice, which usually have a collection of symbols on them instead of pips. Players place their stakes on a layout containing six symbols, and win if any of the dice show their chosen symbol, paying out 1√ó for each die that shows the symbol.</p>
    <p>Crown & Anchor itself seems to date from the late 19th or early 20th century. It was especially popular amongst British soldiers during World War I.</p>
    <p>In Chinese communities the game is called <span lang="nan-Latn">h√ª h√™ hƒÅu</span> <span lang="nan">È≠öËù¶È±ü</span>,<Cite r={GamblingGamesOfMalaya} page={109} /> usually romanized as ‚ÄúHoo Hey How‚Äù. In India it is Jhandi Munda (‡§ù‡§Ç‡§°‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§Ç‡§°‡§æ) or Khora Khore (‡§ñ‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§ñ‡•ã‡§∞‡•á), while in Nepal it is <span lang="ne-Latn">langur burja</span> (<span lang="ne">‡§≤‡§Ç‡§ó‡•Ç‡§∞ or ‡§≤‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§¨‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§æ</span>).
