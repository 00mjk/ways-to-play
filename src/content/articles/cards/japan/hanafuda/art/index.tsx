      <p>In their original form, <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span> were courtly competitions in which various objects were compared as to their qualities or unique attributes:<Footnote>Although the same terminology of <span lang="ja-Latn">awase</span> was also used for sports such as cock-fighting.<Cite r={WorldOfTheShiningPrince} page={165} /></Footnote> objects that were judged in these competitions included artifacts such as fans or paintings;<Cite r={BrocadeByNight} page={242} /> flowers and plants (chrysanthemums, iris roots,<Cite r={WorldOfTheShiningPrince} page={163} /> wild pinks); animals (insects, song&shy;birds<Cite r={WorldOfTheShiningPrince} page={163} />); incense; tea<Cite r={AnIntroductionToJapaneseTeaRitual} page={26} />; or — what we are most interested in here — shells.</p>
      <p>The competitions were generally organized between two teams, named Left (who began the game, and usually had higher-ranking members)<Footnote>In Japan, the left-hand side was traditionally considered the dominant or “masculine” side (see the <a href="#kai-awase-to-kai-oi">naming of shells below</a>), the opposite of European tradition. In the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period, the Minister of the Left (<span lang="ja">左大臣</span>) outranked the Minister of the Right (<span lang="ja">右大臣</span>).</Footnote> and Right, and consisted of a series of rounds in which each team would present one item at a time, often with accompanying poem. Another format involved the presentation of a selection of objects on a miniature artificial garden or island called a <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> (<span lang="ja">洲浜</span>), which was constructured especially for the competition and which could be made out of expensive wood or precious metals.</p>

        A depiction of the full-moon competition including two <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>, from an edition of unknown date.
      </ArticleImage>
      <p>In 966, Emperor Murakami held a <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span> competition on the 15th of the 8th month (the most important full moon of the year). The construction of each team’s <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> is recorded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiga_Monogatari"><cite lang="ja-Latn">Eiga Monogatari</cite></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Both sides worked furiously, determined not to be outdone. The contestants from the Office of Painting submitted a painted landscape tray depicting flowering plants of heavenly beauty, a garden stream, and massive rocks. Various kinds of insects were lodged in a rustic fence made of silver foil. The artists had also painted a view of the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ōi</Noun> River, showing figures strolling nearby and cormorant boats with basket fires. Near the insects there was a poem.</p>
        <p>The Office of Palace Works presented an interesting tray, carved with great ingenuity to resemble a high tide, which they had planted with artifical flowers and carved bamboo and pines. Their poem was attached to a spray of fresh <span lang="ja-Latn"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrinia">ominaeshi</a></span>.<Cite r={JapaneseAristocraticLife} page={92} /></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>These elaborate competitions could run all day; another famous competition held by Emperor Murakami six years earlier (on the 30th day of the 3rd month of 960), ran from 4 p.m. until dawn, when the drunken winning team exited while singing and dancing. A courtier’s diary recorded the elaborate preparations made at the palace:<Cite r={MuseInCompetition} page={[[214, 217]]} /></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>[…] Special care was taken on this occasion as many eminent people of refined taste would be attending the event, and so new plants and flowers were carefully chosen and added to the garden. The Chamberlain Minor Captain <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Sukenobu</Noun> was in charge of the garden, and he had oak logs arranged like a fence and entwined with ivy so that it looked like a cedar forest. He also placed stepping stones here and there so that one could walk along on them. The garden gave the impression of a pastoral landscape and looked more delightful than usual.</p>
        <p>The blinds were replaced by new ones. The Emperor’s seat was arranged in the anteroom at the southern end of the gallery. The atmosphere was so pleasant that it defied description. […]</p>
        <p>[…] The poems [of the Left] were engraved on the silver leaves of golden-yellow mountain roses placed in the <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>—truly a beautiful work of art of exquisite workmanship. The tables were made of rosewood and other wood. The design of the <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> was quite interesting and charming. The cover was of varied shades of dark red and wisteria were embroidered on it; the mat was of violet brocade. Then two court girls […] brought in another <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> for scoring, the design of which was wisteria tendrils made of gold and silver. A twig was to be removed each time a point was scored.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As mentioned in the last paragraph, a special <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> could be used for scoring. During a contest in 1035 one side planted miniature pine trees to track their score; at another in 1078, “the Left inserted arrows with silver shafts and glass feathers into a target to mark their wins, and the Right placed tiny replicas of musical instruments in a silver box inlaid with crystal.”<Cite r={BrocadeByNight} page={243} /><Footnote>Elaborate scoring tracks were <a href="https://images.dnpartcom.jp/ia/workDetail?id=TAM000634">also used for incense competitions</a>.</Footnote></p>
      <Section title={<>An aside about <span lang="ja-Latn">Uta-awase</span></>}>
        <p>Out of all the types of competition, the most esteemed was to eventually be the poetry match (<span lang="ja">歌合わせ</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">uta-awase</span>). At first it was a competition like the others, where the poem was treated as an <em>object</em> to be chosen and presented by the competitor, the poet might not even be present, and more attention was paid to the accompanying costumes and music than the quality of the poetry.<Cite r={BrocadeByNight} page={242} /> </p>
        <p>The poetry competition was highly ritualized, where the result of a contest was not only about who could compose the better poem; on average, authors of a higher rank were more likely to win. In some cases, the winner of a round was decided by convention, and furthermore, some poems could not lose. The first poem presented by the Left team, a poem complimenting the host, or a poem by the Emperor himself would <em>at worst</em> result in a draw.<Cite r={UtaawaseJudgments} page={102} /> At one competition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Uda">Emperor <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Uda</Noun></a> (<span lang="ja">宇多天皇</span>) awarded his own poem a draw, stating “how can an imperial poem lose?”<Cite r={BrocadeByNight} page={244} /></p>
        <p>Later, during what <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ito Setsuko</Noun> terms the “silver age” of <span lang="ja-Latn">uta-awase</span>,<Cite r={MuseInCompetition} page={207} /> the work of the poet became more important, and poetry competitions were held without the extravagant <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>. The competitions became more austere and aware of the world outside the courtly realm; in 1083 a planned grand competition was cancelled as it was thought to be inappropriate given the unrest at the time.<Footnote>i.e., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genpei_War"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Genpei</Noun> war.</a></Footnote> Smaller and more intimate competitions were held with poetry as their focus. This doesn’t mean that the proceedings were any less elaborate; the largest competition of this type involved nine poets competing over 1500 rounds.</p>

        <p>The earliest recorded <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn" word="kai-awase" pronouncer="skent" file={pronKaiAwase} /> (<span lang="ja">貝合せ</span>, ‘shell competition’) contest dates from 1040, and was held at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Grand_Shrine">the Ise shrine</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Suzaku">Emperor Go-Suzaku</a>’s first daughter, Princess <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nagako</Noun>. This was a competition very much in the spirit of the other <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span> games, and consisted of twenty rounds, each shell being presented with an accompanying poem.<Cite r={JapaneseGamesOfMemory} page={269} /></p>
        <p><span lang="ja-Latn">Kai-awase</span> developed from this early comparing-competition form into a completely different style of game called <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-ōi</span> (<span lang="ja">貝覆い</span>, ‘shell covering’) that was based upon collecting matching pairs of shells. <span lang="ja-Latn">Kai-awase</span> itself died out and there is no record of any competitions taking place after the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period.<Cite r={JapaneseGamesOfMemory} page={270} /> However, by the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Edo</Noun> period, the two terms would be conflated, with <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span> being used for the matching game as well,<Cite r={KaiOi} /><Cite r={JapaneseGamesOfMemory} page={270} /> and today <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span> is the term most commonly used for replica game sets.</p>

        <p>Unlike <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span>, the new game was exclusively played with clam (<span lang="ja">蛤</span>) shells, and it offered definitive terms for deciding the winner. In one method of play, the left-hand sides of the shells — also termed the “male” or ‘ground’ (<span lang="ja">地</span>) shells — were arranged face-down on the ground. The right-hand sides — the “female” or ‘coming out’ (<span lang="ja">出</span>) shells — were then drawn from their <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-oke</span> (<span lang="ja">貝桶</span>, ‘shell bucket’) one-by-one and the players would attempt to match them with those on the floor. Whoever was the first to point out a (successful) match would capture both halves of the shell, and the winner was the player who collected the most shells.</p>
        <p>Early instructional books for women from the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Muromachi</Noun> period (1392–1573) include rules that state that the game is played with twelve shells,<Footnote>A video showing how this game would have been played can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4_bz-okxM">here</a>.</Footnote> which should be arranged in a circle on the ground, and that the drawn shell should be placed in the centre, with the pointed end (“head”) directed towards the highest-ranking person in the room.<Cite r={JapaneseGamesOfMemory} page={270} /> Evidently the game could get physical, as those same books warn that “to quarrel and remove shells by force is something that only men and courtesans do.”</p>
        <p>The monk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshida_Kenk%C5%8D" lang="ja-Latn" className="proper-noun">Kenkō</a> (<span lang="ja">兼好</span>, <abbr title="died">d.</abbr> <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1352) also offered guidance in his book <cite>Essays in Idleness</cite>, published around 1330:<Cite r={EssaysInIdleness} page={130} />
        <Footnote><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kenkō</Noun> goes on to apply this strategic advice as part of an extended metaphor for good governance and living well: “In all things, do not seek for distant advantage. Simply maintain correctly what is close to hand. In the words of the Chinese sage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Pu">Duke Xiao of Qing</a>, ‘Do what is good, and ask no questions of the future.’ Surely a ruler should also govern in this way.”</Footnote></p>
        <blockquote>If someone engaged in a game of shell matching neglects the shells in front of him while he looks around to check what others might be hiding in their sleeves or by their knees, his own shells will be snatched from in front of him. Those who are good at the game seem not to go to the length of taking shells from distant players but limit themselves to those close at hand, yet they manage to acquire a large number.</blockquote>
        <p>While later depictions (such as the images above) usually represent the game as only played by women, diary entries and paintings from the time show that the game was originally played by everyone, often in mixed teams. Losing teams would also request re-matches to try to beat the victorious team.<Cite r={JapaneseGamesOfMemory} page={257} /></p>
        <p>Records of the imperial household indicate that the shell-matching game was played formally nearly five hundred times over the period 1481–1589, sometimes as many as nine times a month.<Cite r={JapaneseGamesOfMemory} page={257} /></p>

        <p>When played with many shells, the game must have been difficult, since the clues that point to a match are solely the subtle shades and contours of the shell, and the only way to test if shells truly match is to pick them up and attempt to join them together. Considering that traditional sets could contain up to 360 shells,<Footnote>Modern replicas usually only have around 54.</Footnote> this was a game for a class of person who had a lot of leisure time on their hands.</p>
        <p>Later the game set itself turned into a luxury item: the interior of the shells was at first decorated with matching fabrics, and then elaborately painted or even gilded. After the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kamakura</Noun> period (1333), it became common to illustrate the shells with matching scenes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji">Tale of Genji</a> (<span lang="ja">源氏物語</span> <Pronounce word="Genji monogatari" file={pronGenjiMonogatari} pronouncer="straycat88" lang="ja-Latn" />) — the game is also played in Chapter 45 of the novel itself. Other designs included shells with half of a poem in each, so that the matching pair could be read as a complete poem; these types of the game would eventually evolve into the <span lang="ja-Latn">uta-garuta</span> (<span lang="ja">歌骨牌</span>) poetry cards.</p>

      <Section title="Banning &amp; Legalization">
        <p>Some time after its introduction, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> games were restricted as part of a total ban on gambling introduced during the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kansei</Noun> Reforms<Footnote>During the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kansei</Noun> Reforms, gambling was prohibited by the <span lang="ja">博奕賭ノ勝負禁止ノ儀ニ付触書</span>, promulgated by Matsudaira Sadanobu on the 12th of January, 1788.<Cite r={SatireWithinKibyōshi} page={44} /></Footnote> (1787–1793).

        <p>Things had already begun to change in 1885, after a ban on Western playing cards (<span lang="ja">西洋かるた</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">seiyō karuta</span>) was lifted due to complaints from foreign officials.<Cite r={EbashiHanafuda} page={[[189, 192]]} /> <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Maeda Kihei</Noun><Footnote><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Kihei</Noun> appears to have been something of a rogue: he is somewhat infamous in the philately community for selling collections of counterfeit stamps to unsuspecting tourists.</Footnote> became convinced through his reading of legal texts that the selling of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> was not actually prohibited, and he moved to <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Tōkyō</Noun> in December 1885 with a plan to open a <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hana&shy;fuda</Noun> shop.

        <blockquote>In times gone by no game of cards having any resemblance to gambling was played among the gentry; moral discipline forbade such. Since the introduction of European ideas, the rigidity of discipline has somewhat slackened and cards are now played to some extent. Nevertheless, people do not consider card-playing good taste. If they play they do so with some diffidence, somewhat in a similar way as smoking is done by ladies in European society nowadays.</blockquote>

        <p>During this period, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</Noun> managed to survive in part by taking up the manufacture of regional patterns of Japanese cards (<span lang="ja">地方札</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">chihōfuda</span>), whose original, small-time, manufacturers had failed due to the new taxation law.<Cite r={NintendoHistory} /></p>
        <p>By the mid to late 20th century, interest in the game was waning. A poll by Japan’s Cabinet Office in 1956 indicated that only 9% of people played <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>, compared with 28% who played with Western playing cards.<Cite r={CabinetOfficeEntertainment} /></p>
        <p>Starting in the late 20th century, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> seems to have had something of a revival. “Character” decks featuring popular <span lang="ja-Latn">anime</span> and <span lang="ja-Latn">manga</span> characters began to be produced, and the popularity of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> has also been boosted by films featuring the cards, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Wars"><cite>Summer Wars</cite></a> (2009).</p>
        <p>While Japan produces many new types of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> <em>cards</em>, in Korea <Noun lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</Noun> <em>games</em> appear to be much more popular than their Japanese counterparts, and several films about gambling with <Noun lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</Noun> — most prominently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazza:_The_High_Rollers"><cite lang="ko-Latn">Tazza</cite></a> series (2006, 2014, 2019) — have been box-office successes.</p>
        <p>Image search results on Instagram (as of writing in 2021) for the hashtags <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%E8%8A%B1%E6%9C%AD/"><code>#花札</code></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%ED%99%94%ED%88%AC/"><code>#화투</code></a> show about twice as many Korean-tagged images, despite Korea having only a third of the number of Instagram users that Japan has.<Cite r={JapaneseInstagramUsers}/><Cite r={KoreanInstagramUsers} /> The content of the images also gives many clues to the game’s popularity: Korean images often show games in progress, and many times being played for money, whereas Japanese images are often just of the cards themselves, focusing on their æsthetic value.</p>

    <Section title="The Art of the Cards">
      <p>The culture of the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Edo</Noun> period in which <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> cards first appeared was heavily in&shy;flu&shy;enced by the aristocratic culture of the earlier <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period. As such, the artwork on the cards abounds with references to <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period literature, festivals, and artistic tropes:</p>
      <blockquote className="blockquote">
        <p>With the exception of the peony, which entered the poetic canon in the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Edo</Noun> period, all the images are from classical poetry of the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heian</Noun> period and reflect urban commoners’ knowledge of the poetic and cultural associations of the months.<Cite r={FourSeasons} page={[[1739, 1741]]} pageType="l." /></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Artistically, the cards derive from the <span lang="ja-Latn">kachō-ga</span> (<span lang="ja">花鳥画</span> ‘flower and bird image’) tra&shy;dition. Artworks created in this style often have poems written upon them, and these appear on some cards of the <span lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> pattern.</p>

    <Section title="Hanafuda Patterns">
      <p>A playing-card ‘pattern’ is a common set of designs that has been used by multiple different manufacturers over a period of time. With <span lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> there is now one primary or “standard” pattern: all other patterns are referred to as ‘local cards’ (<span lang="ja">地方札</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">chihōfuda</span>), and considered to be specific to a particular region. Most of these are of historical interest only and are no longer manufactured, and there is little information about how gameplay differed in different regions.</p>
      <Section title={<>Standard (<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hachihachi-bana</Noun>)</>}>
        <p>The standard pattern is now one that is called <Pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" word="hachihachi-bana" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronHachihachibana} /> (<span lang="ja">八八花</span>/<span lang="ja">八々花</span>), since it was primarily used to play the game <span lang="ja">八八</span> ‘88’. Almost all decks use this pattern, and images from it are used to show the cards of each month below.</p>

        <Section title="Korean deck differences">
          <p>Korean decks are also based on the <span lang="ja-Latn">hachi­hachi­-bana</span> pattern, but the ribbons are usually blue instead of purple, and there is Korean text on the standard three red ribbons (labelled <span lang="ko">홍단</span>, <Pronounce lang="ko-Latn" pronouncer="glamstar77" word="hongdan" file={pronHongdan} /> ‘crimson ribbon’) and all three blue ribbons (<span lang="ko">청단</span>, <Pronounce lang="ko-Latn" word="cheongdan" pronouncer="glamstar77" file={pronCheongdan} /> ‘blue ribbon’).</p>

          <p>There are also differences in the ‘rain man’ (see below), and depending on the deck, other aspects of the cards can also be translated into Korean cultural terms. For example, the lesser cuckoo of the Japanese cards is in some decks the Oriental magpie, which is the national bird of Korea.</p>

        <p><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Dairen-bana</Noun> (<span lang="ja-Latn">大連花</span>) is an extinct regional pattern from city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian"><Noun lang="zh-Latn">Dalian</Noun></a> (<span lang="zh">大连市</span>) in China. It dates from the era of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwantung_Leased_Territory">Kwangtung Leased Territory</a>, when Japan occupied the region from 1905 until the end of WWII. The pattern possibly existed as a way to reduce government taxation on cards, as cards sold in occupied regions did not attract the same level of tax as those sold within Japan’s own islands.</p>
        <p>The main distinguishing feature of the pattern is that each type of <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> card has its own background pattern (as opposed to the usual ‘confetti’). The remainder of the cards follow the standard pattern very closely.</p>

    <Section title="The Cards in Depth">
      <p>A short note about the ordering of the deck: while nominally the cards start in ‘January’, at the time the deck was created Japan’s calendar was based upon the lunisolar Chinese calendar, which started in what is now February. This explains why ‘March’ is the month of the cherry blossom when — according to the current calendar — it should be April,<Footnote>In Kyoto from the 11th to 13th centuries, the average peak of the cherry blossom season was April 17th.<Cite r={FourSeasons} page={484} pageType="l." /></Footnote> and why ‘August’ shows the full moon when the full moon festival (<span lang="ja">月見</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="skent" word="tsukimi" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronTsukimi} />) actually falls in September–October.</p>
      <p>However, even with these modifications the eleventh (willow) and twelfth (paulownia) months are in the wrong place. The eleventh month depicts rain, willows, and a frog, all of which are associated with summer.</p>
      <p>In Korea, an altered ordering is used where the ‘November’ and ‘December’ months are switched. There is also another ordering used in Japan which might be called the “<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Nagoya</Noun> ordering”, as it is used in several games from that region.<Footnote>This order will be explained when I get around to writing the games articles!</Footnote></p>

        <p>The bush warbler (<span lang="ja">鶯</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">uguisu</span>) was praised for its song, and one of its cries is said to repeat the phrase <span lang="ja-Latn">hō-hoke-kyō</span>, the Japanese name of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Sutra">Lotus Sutra</a> (<span lang="ja">法華経</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">hokekyō</span>).

        <p>The third month is represented by cherry trees in bloom (<span lang="ja">桜</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" word="sakura" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronSakura} />). Blossom-viewing (<span lang="ja">花見</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="samchie" word="hanami" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronHanami} />), parti­cularly of cherry blossoms, is a custom that dates back to the Heian period. The curtains (<span lang="ja">幕</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="skent" word="maku" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronMaku} />) that are shown on the bright card are there provide privacy whilst viewing cherry blossoms. An example of their use can be seen in the image on the left. It was common to use striped fabric, particularly in red &amp; white, while nobility would use curtains bearing their family crest.</p>
        <p>The <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> of the March cards reads <span lang="ja-Latn">mi&shy;yoshino</span> <span lang="ja">みよしの</span> ‘beautiful <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Yoshino</Noun>’,<Footnote>
          Some older cards spell this phrase differently, some examples are: <span lang="ja">みよし𛂙</span>, <span lang="ja">美よし𛂙</span>, or <span lang="ja">みよし𛂜</span>.
            Other phrases seen on the cherry <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> include <span lang="ja">す𛀙𛂦𛃰</span> (<span lang="ja">すがわら</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">sugawara</span>), or <span lang="ja">宇良す</span> (<span lang="ja">うらす</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span>). Both of these are references to the <a href="/games/hachi-hachi"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hachi-Hachi</Noun></a> <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> ‘<span lang="ja">うらすがわら</span>’ (<span lang="ja-Latn">urasugawara</span>).

The term <span lang="ja-Latn">miyoshino</span> is <a href="http://www.wakapoetry.net/?s=miyosino">often used to refer to this location</a> in the imperial poetry collections.</p>
        <p>In 1688, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsuo_Bash%C5%8D"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Matsuo Bashō</Noun></a> (<span lang="ja">松尾芭蕉</span>), Japan’s most famed composer of <span lang="ja-Latn">hokku</span>, visited <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Yoshino</Noun> during his travels but found himself unable to compose a single poem, overwhelmed by the pressure of trying to live up to his predecessors.<Cite r={NarrowRoad} page={84} /> One of them, <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Yasuhara Teishitsu</Noun> (<span lang="ja">安原貞室</span>), had composed what <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Bashō</Noun> considered to be the “finest <span lang="ja-Latn">hokku</span> ever written”:<Cite r={TheClassicTraditionOfHaiku} page={8} /></p>

        <p>The fourth month is represented by wisteria (<span lang="ja">藤</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="kaoring" word="fuji" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronFuji} />). These cards are also nicknamed ‘black bean’ (<span lang="ja">黒豆</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="usako_usagiclub" word="kuromame" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronKuromame} />), due to their appearance. This month shows the tran&shy;sition from spring to summer; the lesser cuckoo (<span lang="ja">ホトトギス</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="forsmith" word="hototogisu" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronHototogisu} />) is a bird of summer,<Cite r={FourSeasons} page={1065} pageType="l." /> while wisteria is associated with the passage of spring into summer;<Cite r={FourSeasons} page={1021} pageType="l." /> it is also known as the ‘two-season plant’ (<span lang="ja">二季草</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">niki&shy;sou</span>). Like the bush warbler and spring, the first cry of the cuckoo was considered to announce the beginning of summer. By the time of the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Edo</Noun> period this was perhaps more of a poetic dream than reality; the poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosa_Buson"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Buson</Noun></a> remarked that he had only heard the bird twice, despite living in Kyoto for 20 years.<Cite r={TheClassicTraditionOfHaiku} page={56} /></p>
        <p>The cuckoo swooping in front of the moon is a common motif in Japanese art. It is tempting to claim that this may be a reference to the tale of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Yorimasa</Noun> from the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Heike Monogatari</Noun>,<Cite r={HeikeMonogatari} page={[[161, 163]]} /> but the oldest decks do not have a moon on this card.</p>

        <p>In Korean contexts the non-<span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> wisteria cards are almost always shown upside-down, so that the plants are presented in the same manner as the bush clover in the seventh month. The cards are also referred to as <span lang="ko">흑싸리</span>, “black bush clover”, possibly because wisteria is not native to Korea. The <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card is never shown inverted.</p>

          Bush clover in bloom.
        </ArticleImage>
        <Footnote standalone>
          One common species of bush clover in Japan is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lespedeza_thunbergii"><cite>Lespedeza thunbergii</cite></a>, named after the Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg who visited Japan from 1775–6. Oddly enough, Thunberg also collected some <span lang="ja-Latn">karuta</span> decks during his stay, and was probably the first European to take one back to Europe. His decks are now <a href="http://collections.smvk.se/carlotta-em/web/object/1000639">in the Swedish Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm</a>. (Thanks to Marcus Richert for pointing out this connection.)
        </Footnote>
        <p>The seventh month is represented by bush clover (<span lang="ja">萩</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" word="hagi" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronHagi} />). These cards are also nicknamed ‘red bean’ (<span lang="ja">赤豆</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">akamame</span>/<span lang="ja">小豆</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" word="azuki" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronAzuki} />). Bush clover is very strongly associated with autumn — the Japanese character <span lang="ja">萩</span> is a composition of <span lang="ja">秋</span> ‘autumn’ and <span lang="ja">艹</span> (full form <span lang="ja">艸</span>) ‘grass’.</p>

        <p>Bush clover is also (along with miscanthus, see the next month) considered one of the “seven flowers of autumn” (<span lang="ja">秋の七草</span>), a term which derives from a pair of poems in the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Man’yōshū</Noun> (book 8:1537–8):<Cite r={TheManyoshu} page={212} /></p>
        <div className="multi">

            There they are—<br />

            The fringed pink, and the agrimony,<br />
            And last the blithe ‘morning face’.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The bush clover is referred to in the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Man’yōshū</Noun> even more than the plum or cherry blossoms.<Cite r={ElementsOfJapaneseDesign} page={54} /></p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the wild boar pictured on the <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card does not feature in any of the imperial poetry collections. As a representative of rural life, it was considered to be outside the boundaries of the aristocratic worldview of the poets.
          For the common people, however, the boar was very important as a source of food. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Tenmu">Emperor Tenmu</a> banned the consumption of meat in 675, only cattle, horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens were prohibited.<Cite r={FourSeasons} page={4261} pageType="l." /> Wild game such as boar and deer were not included: either they escaped the imagination of the Emperor, or they were too important as food sources for commoners.

        <p>The bold moon card is possibly the most well-recognized of all <span lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> cards.

        <p>Traditionally, the most important date of the year for moon viewing was the 15th day of the 8th month (<span lang="ja">中秋観月</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">chūshū kangetsu</span>);<Cite r={WorldOfTheShiningPrince} page={176} /> the full moon always fell on the 15th due to the way the calendar was constructed.<Cite r={WorldOfTheShiningPrince} page={170} /></p>

        <p>During the festival, chrysanthemum petals are added to sake and consumed.

        <p>Chrysanthemums were also prized for their secular beauty, and collectors competed to breed particularly beautiful varieties.</p>
        <p>The chrysanthemum is also used as a symbol by the Emperor of Japan. It was first adopted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Toba">Emperor <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Go-Toba</Noun></a> (<abbr title="reigned">r.</abbr> 1183–1198), but was not restricted to this purpose until the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</Noun> period. In modern times a stylized version of the chrysanthemum flower is used as the Chrysanthemum Seal (<span lang="ja">菊紋</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kikumon</span>), which is the crest of the Emperor of Japan (who uses a 16-petal version) and other members of the imperial family (who use a 14-petal version).</p>

          The cards for November show willow trees. There is one bright card, one <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card, one red <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> card, and one <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> card.
        </ArticleImage>
        <p>The eleventh month is represented by willow (<span lang="ja">柳</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" word="yanagi" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronYanagi} />); it is also often referred to as ‘rain’ (<span lang="ja">雨</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" word="ame" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronAme} />) or ‘drizzle’ (<span lang="ja">時雨</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" word="shigure"
          lang="ja-Latn" file={pronShigure} />).</p>
        <p>These cards have a strange relationship to the others — in many games they have special powers, or they are valued lower than the cards of other months. For ex&shy;ample, the bright of November will often score less than the other four brights, and in some games the “lightning card” has special powers, such as being able to match any other card.</p>

        <p>The man pictured on the bright card is the poet <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ono no Michikaze</Noun> (<span lang="ja">小野道風</span>), who is considered to be one of the founders of Japanese calligraphy. The jumping frog re&shy;calls an episode in his life: he had failed seven times to achieve a promotion, and was considering abandoning his attempts. One day, walking beside a stream, he saw a frog attempting to jump onto a willow branch. Seven times it jumped, and seven times it failed. On the eighth attempt, the frog reached the branch successfully. <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Michikaze</Noun> was thus inspired to persevere with his attempts.<Cite r={AnimalInFarEasternArt} page={[[86, 87]]} /></p>
        <p>On older decks a different “rain man” is pictured. On these cards the man is running in the rain with the umbrella closed around his head. This feature is preserved in the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</Noun> pattern.</p>

          The paulownia crest was most famously used by the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</Noun> family.
        </ArticleImage>
        <p>The twelfth month is represented by paulownia (<span lang="ja">桐</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="kaoring" word="kiri" lang="ja-Latn" file={pronKiri} />). This is a tree that flowers in spring, and has large heart-shaped leaves.</p>
        <p>The paulownia as a symbol was originally used by the imperial family and ranked second only to the chrysanthemum. Use of the paulownia was granted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Daigo">Emperor <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Go-Daigo</Noun></a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_Takauji"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ashikaga Takauji</Noun></a>, whose descendants used it until the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_shogunate"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ashikaga</Noun> shogunate</a> in 1573. After this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Y%C5%8Dzei">Emperor <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Go-Yōzei</Noun></a> granted use of the crest to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi"><Noun lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</Noun></a> (1537–1598), the second of the three “Great Unifiers” of Japan, and today it is most strongly associated with the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</Noun> family. However, as <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</Noun> in turn allowed its use by so many of his allies, it is also now the most common crest in Japan.</p>
        <p>In modern times, the paulownia symbol is also associated with the government. This use started after the <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</Noun> restoration, and it appears on the seal of the prime minister’s office. There are many versions of the crest, with the 3–5–3 flower version being most common. The 5-7–5 version is of higher standing and is the one used by the government.</p>
        <p>The wood of the paulownia is light and strong and often used for boxes; it is very fast-growing and also somewhat fire-proof, so was useful as a storage material. Older high-quality <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> decks came encased in an outer box of paulownia wood. The manufacturer <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi Tengudo</Noun> still boxes many of their decks in this way.</p>

According to legend the phoenix will only land on a paulownia tree. What appear to be ‘spikes’ on the card are really its long tail feathers. This card is sometimes casually referred to as the “rooster” card.</p>
        <p>One of the <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards is usually coloured, often yellow, but sometimes with red as well. In some games it becomes a <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card, or even a <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> card.</p>
