    <p>Mill games are a family of boardgames also known as <i>Morris</i> or <i>Merels</i> games. The main aim of any mill game is to try to form a row of three pieces, which is called a ‘mill’, and which usually allows the player to remove one of the opponent’s pieces from the board (usually not from another mill).</p>
    <p>Most mill games are split into two phases of <i>placement</i> and <i>movement</i>, so that all pieces are placed on the board before any pieces are moved.</p>

      <p>Many of the games overlap so much that they could be considered to be the same game. For example, <GameRef id="morabaraba" /> as standardized by Mind Sports South Africa has only two small differences from <GameRef id='nine-mens-morris' fragment="#twelve-mens-morris">Twelve Men’s Morris</GameRef> as standardized by the <Noun lang="de">Weltmühlespiel Dachverband</Noun>. However, I have chosen to describe it separately due to the interesting history and cultural context around the game.</p>
      <p>The most important representative of the type is <GameRef id='nine-mens-morris' />, and it is a good place to start if you have never played this type of game before.</p>
