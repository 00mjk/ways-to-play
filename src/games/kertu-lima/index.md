<span class="noun" lang="jav-Latn">Kertu Lima</span> (‘five cards’) is an unusual
trick-taking game from Java, played with [Ceki
cards](/articles/cards/ceki/).[@JavaanseKaartspelen p. 46–57]

<!-- excerpt -->

## Setup

<span class="noun" lang="jav-Latn">Kertu Lima</span> is played by at least five and up to
nine players. A single deck of 60 ceki cards is used.

To determine where players sit, pairs of cards can be used, dealing one half to
the table and the other half of each pair to a player. The players sit where the
corresponding cards are on the table.

Play is in anti-clockwise order as in other south-east asian games.
 
Cut for the highest card (Red Flower, Old Thousand, or 1 Myriads counting 10 and
others their rank) to determine who is the dealer. The dealer shuffles and the
player to their left cuts the deck. The dealer deals each player five cards, and
then the player to their right begins the game.

## Play

The starting player can lead any card to a trick. The subsequent players try to
‘kill’ (<span lang="jav">ꦩꦠꦼꦤꦶ</span> <span lang="jav-Latn">mateni</span>
or formal <span lang="jav-Latn">mejahi</span>) the led card by playing one of
_equal or higher_ rank, within the same group (see below).

A player does not have to beat the card led but _must_ play one of the same
group if possible. If they have no cards in the same group they toss in any card
face-down (<span lang="jav-Latn">mberi</span>).

The highest card (or last card of equal value) played to the trick wins it, and
the player who played it leads to the next trick. The aim of the game is to be
the winner of the _last_ (fifth) trick played. The outcomes of the previous
tricks do not count towards winning at all.

The winner of the round is called the <span lang="jav-Latn">banjiran</span>
(‘flooded’), and shuffles and deals for the next round. If they win a second
game they are called <span lang="jav-Latn">mbanjir</span> (‘abundance’?), and if
a third and fourth, <span lang="jav-Latn">ladoe</span> (‘eruption’?).

A pair of top-ranking cards, i.e. a pair of any <span
lang="jav-Latn">dika</span>, or the 9 of Strings or Coins, the 4 of Coins, or
the old Thousand, is unbeatable if led, and is called a <span
lang="jav-Latn">mraji</span>.

If the starting player has a hand with two pairs of <span
lang="jav-Latn">mraji</span>, they can reveal all four cards (<span
lang="jav-Latn">mraji papat</span> ‘four <span lang="jav-Latn">mraji</span>’);
these four cards would be unbeatable. The other players then discard down to one
card and the final trick is played out.

## Scoring and payment

## Card groups

### <span lang="jav-Latn">Cina cilik</span> (‘little Chinese’)

There are ten cards in this group: the Myriad cards from {% cards '2–9' %} are
all of equal rank. In the same group, but ranked higher, are Red Flower, and
then Old Thousand is the highest.

<div class="multi">

    alt=";;;;;;;" %}
Then the rest of the Myriads cards (aside from {% cards '1' %}) are ranked equally.
{%imageEnd%}

### 3 & 4 Coins

There are only two cards in this group; the 4 of Coins outranks the 3 of Coins.

<div class="multi">
{% image
    noborder=true
    size="small"
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CC4.jpg"
    alt="" %}
4 Coins is the higher-ranking.
{%imageEnd%}
{% image
    noborder=true
    size="small"
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CC3.jpg"
    alt="" %}
3 Coins is the lower-ranking.
{%imageEnd%}

### 8 & 9 Coins

There are only two cards in this group; the 9 of Coins outranks the 8 of Coins.

<div class="multi">
{% image
    noborder=true
    size="small"
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CC9.jpg"
    alt="" %}
9 Coins is the higher-ranking.
{%imageEnd%}
{% image
    noborder=true
    size="small"
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CC8.jpg"
    alt="" %}
8 Coins is the lower-ranking.
{%imageEnd%}


### <span lang="jav-Latn">Lintrik cilik</span> (‘little rows’)

There are four cards in this group; the 9 of Strings outranks the 8 of Strings,
and the 5 & 7 of Strings are of equal rank.

<div class="multi">
{% image
    noborder=true
    size="small"
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CS9.jpg"
    alt="" %}
9 Strings is the highest-ranking.
{%imageEnd%}
{% image

    size="small"
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CS8.jpg"
    alt="" %}
8 Strings is the second-highest.
{%imageEnd%}
{% image
    noborder=true
    size="small"
    alt=";"
    src="../../articles/cards/ceki/CS7.jpg;../../articles/cards/ceki/CS5.jpg" %}
5 & 7 Strings are ranked equally.
{%imageEnd%}
</div>

### <span lang="jav-Latn">Dika</span>

The remaining 12 cards are in this group.  The name of this group comes from the
work <span lang="jav-Latn">mardika</span> meaning ‘free, independent, not in
service to someone else’. This group should really be thought of as 12 different
groups,{%fn%}As pointed out in @JavaanseKaartspelenReview [p. 350].{%endfn%} one
for each card, as the cards in this group can only be beaten by their identical
copy (there are two copies of each card).

Note that because these are really 12 separate groups, if one of the <span
lang="jav-Latn">dika</span> is led, the only card that is forced to be played is
its matching partner (which, if played, must win the trick). You do not have to
throw away another <span lang="jav-Latn">dika</span> as a discard.

The cards are:
