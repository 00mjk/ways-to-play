This is a simple children’s game that seems to originate from China, where it is
known by many names. Because the board is shaped like the Chinese character
‘<span lang="zh">区</span>’ (‘area’), it is known as ‘area character game’ <span
lang="zh">区字棋</span>. Other names include ‘crotch game’ <span lang="zh">裤裆
棋</span>, or ‘scissor game’ <span lang="zh">剪刀棋</span>. (TODO:
transliterations!)

In Cantonese it is called <span lang="yue">崩口棋</span> <span
lang="yue-Latn">bong1 hau2 kei4</span>,[@KoreanGames p.
100][@PangHauKiImage]{%fn%}In older books (such as Culin’s) this is
transliterated as “pong hau k’i”.{%endfn%} which means ‘cleft lip game’ (based
on the shape of the board).

In Korea it is known as <span lang="ko">우물고누</span> <span
lang="ko-Latn">umulgonu</span> ‘well game’ or <span lang="ko">강고누</span>
<span lang="ko-Latn">ganggonu</span> ‘river game’.[@KoreanGames p. 100] In
Punjabi it is called <span lang="pa-Latn">dō-guṭi</span> (TODO: possibly
<span lang="pa">ਦੋਗੁਟਿ</span>?).[@GuptaD p. 143]
