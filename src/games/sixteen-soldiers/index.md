## Play

One player controls a single larger piece which is placed in the centre of the
board. The other 16 pieces are controlled by the other player and placed on the
intersections around the border.

On each player’s turn they move any of their pieces along a line to an adjacent
empty intersection. If the large single piece moves onto the intersection
directly between two other pieces, those pieces are captured and removed from
the board.

The goal of the player with many pieces is to surround the single piece so that
it cannot move. The goal of the single piece is to eliminate enough opposing
pieces that it cannot be surrounded.
