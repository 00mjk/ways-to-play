{%aside%}
The @GuinnessMusicFacts [p. 266] states that the “first English
recording of a dance band with vocal refrain” was of a song entitled ‘Puck-a-Pu’, sung by
Ernest Pike with the Mayfair Dance Orchestra, on the 9th of November 1920. The recording can be
heard
[here](http://www.mgthomas.co.uk/Soundfiles/Ragtime/Mayfair%20Dance%20Orch%20-%20Puck-A-Pu.mp3). 
Note that it can best be described as “musical Chinoiserie”, and the lyrics are fairly racist.
{%endaside%}

In English reports the name of the game is usually given as
“pakapoo”/“pak-a-poo” or “pakapu”/“pak-a(h)-pu”. Other variants are “pak-a-peu”,
“puck-a-pu”, or “pac-a-poo”. In Macau it is given with the Portugeuse
romanization of “pacapio”, which remains standard in current usage.

While the specifics vary, the play of the game is simple: each player purchases
one or more tickets upon which they select a number of characters out of 80
different characters. The seller then randomly selects a number of characters at
random, and players win money according to the number of matching characters
marked on their ticket.

## False origins

It is sometimes fancifully claimed that the name of the game was because
originally white pigeons were used to choose winning tickets, but that is not
possible given the way the game is played; it is not a lottery where one or more
tickets are selected to be the winner(s).

According to current Chinese dictionaries, the game was a derivative of
pigeon-racing bets. The story runs that the characters were used to label
pigeons and players would select which pigeons to bet upon based on the
characters assigned to those pigeons. Eventually the pigeons were dropped
entirely and the characters were drawn at random. However, there is no record of
pigeon races and betting being performed in this manner.[@SparrowAndPigeon]

## Known history

According to the [<cite>Draft History of <Noun
lang="zh-Latn">Qing</Noun></cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_History_of_Qing),[@QinYingChapter]
the official <Noun lang="zh-Latn">Qin Ying</Noun> (<span lang="zh">秦瀛</span>,
1743–1821) banned pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the “ninth year of [<Noun
lang="zh-Latn">Jiaqing</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaqing_Emperor)”
(1804/5), so the game must have existed at this point.[@SparrowAndPigeon]

GT translation:

Although the second text above makes the numbering format of racing pigeons more specific and is the same as the numbering format of "White Pigeon Tickets" in "Thousand Characters", it further exposes the theory that it is a fiction attached to later generations. This is because it does not cite any evidence of the provenance, and the undocumented pigeon numbering system originated in the late Qing Dynasty, obviously much later than the "white pigeon ticket" that appeared before the middle of the Qing Dynasty. According to Zhao Lifeng from "Drafts of Qing History. According to the textual research of Qin Ying Biography: "In the ninth year of Jiaqing, Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong", "it seems to be presumed that the white pigeon tickets were produced during the Qianlong period". (22) Therefore, the second article cited above can also be judged as a purely contrived misrepresentation. Although such articles are conclusive and well-founded on the surface, they are in fact unfounded claims. Therefore, the "white pigeon ticket" being edited by "Wikipedia" indicates that the source of this source is yet to be found, and its text is as follows:

… later part

In fact, according to the description of "Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing", which was verified by Zhao Lifeng, it can be inferred that in the ninth year of Jiaqing (February 11, 1804 - January 30, 1805), there were already white pigeons in Guangdong. The pigeon ticket was passed down from Macau. This is because in fact, during the Qianjia period, government officials at all levels, including Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Prefecture, Xiangshan County, etc., had repeatedly ordered Macau's Portuguese leader "Yimu" to prohibit the "gambling incidents" of Chinese and foreign residents in Macau. (42) Although the relevant materials do not clearly mention the way of “gathering”, the author believes that these “gaming events” should be the Western lottery introduced by Portugal and the Chinese lottery inspired by the Chinese. That is caused by the white pigeon ticket. For example, on the seventh day of the third lunar month in the tenth year of Jiaqing (April 6, 1805), Peng Zhaolin, the magistrate of Xiangshan, once investigated the "event of opening bids and gathering gambling by Tibetan merchants", and issued a notice saying: "If people gather to open bids, People who are tempted to invest in silver to buy bids are prohibited from doing so. […] If you dare to disobey and do not comply, and there are still people gathering to open bids, the county will visit the real case, and it will definitely be investigated and dealt with strictly in accordance with Daxian. (43) From the text of the ban, it can be inferred that the “Fan merchants opening bids and gathering gambling incident” had already happened, and was only known by the magistrate far away in Xiangshan County and ordered the ban. Since the lottery issued by the Hall of Mercy began in 1810, it is not Lottery of the Hall of Mercy. The "bid" of "bid opening" and "buying bid" mentioned in the article should be the abbreviation of "white dove label (ticket)". The Portuguese name of the Macau Government Gazette on the 22nd is “Lotaria de China”, which means “Chinese lottery”.(44) It can be seen that the “white pigeon label (ticket)” is a product of Portuguese lottery principles and then transformed by Chinese methods. , so it is called "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery". Moreover, pigeons are mostly gray, brown, white, etc. are a few, and pigeons are generally referred to as "white pigeons", which is a unique phenomenon in Cantonese and Cantonese. It is called "鹁ge" as a result of the transliteration.(45) And the pronunciation of "Piao" as "Biao" is also a phenomenon still preserved in Cantonese dialects. “Bid (ticket)”, and winning the betting ticket is “Zhongma Biao (ticket)”. It is enough to prove that “White Pigeon Bid (ticket)”, a “Chinese lottery” or “Chinese lottery” originated from Portuguese lottery and originated in Guangdong and Macau The lottery was created and officially named by the Cantonese.

DeepL translation of article:
    The second text above, although the numbering form of racing pigeons is more specific and the same as the numbering form of the "White Pigeon Ticket" in the "Thousand Characters", further reveals that it is a posthumous fabrication. This is because it does not give any evidence of its origin, and this unsubstantiated form of numbering of racing pigeons was introduced in the late Qing Dynasty, which is obviously much later than the "white pigeon ticket" that appeared before the middle of the Qing Dynasty. According to Zhao Lifeng from the "Qing dynasty history manuscript. (22) Therefore, it is not surprising that the pigeon ticket was produced around the Qianlong period. (22) Therefore, the second article quoted above can also be concluded as a purely fictitious misrepresentation. This is because although these articles are all well documented and apparently justifiable, they are in fact untraceable and assumed. Therefore, Wikipedia is editing the "pigeon ticket" note to find the origin of this source, the text is as follows.

… much later:

    In fact, according to Zhao Lifeng's testimony that "Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing", it can be assumed that white pigeon tickets existed in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing (February 11, 1804-January 30, 1805) and were transmitted from Macao. This is because, in fact, during the Qian-Jia period, Chinese officials at various levels of government in Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Prefecture, and Xiangshan County repeatedly ordered the Portuguese chiefs of Macau, the "yi mu", to prohibit "gambling events" among the Chinese and foreign residents of Macau. (42) Although the information does not explicitly mention the name of the "gambling events", the author, after a comprehensive study, believes that these "gambling events" were caused by the introduction of the Western lottery from Portugal and the Chinese lottery, or pigeon tickets, which were inspired by the Chinese. For example, on the seventh day of the third month of the tenth year of Jiaqing (April 6, 1805), Peng Zhaolin, the governor of Xiangshan, investigated "the incident of the gambling of the foreign merchants by opening bids," issuing a circular saying: "If the people are confused to buy the bids by opening bids, they are forbidden to do so. [If you do not comply with the law, or if you still have a case of crowded bidding, the county will visit the case and report it to the Grand Constabulary for investigation and serious punishment." (43) From the text of this prohibition, it can be inferred that "the incident of the lottery of a foreign merchant" had already occurred and was prohibited by order of the county magistrate who was far away from Xiangshan County. Since the lottery was first issued in 1810, it is clear that this was not a lottery for Ren Ci Tang. The "bid" mentioned in the article for "opening" and "buying" is an abbreviation of "white pigeon bid (ticket)". The name of the "Pigeon Ticket" in the Macao Government Gazette of May 22, 1872 is "Lotaria de China", which means "Chinese Lottery". (44) It can be seen that the "Lotaria de China" is a Chinese lottery. (44) It can be seen that the "white pigeon (ticket)" is a product of the Portuguese lottery principle and then modified in the Chinese way, so it is called "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery". Moreover, pigeons are mostly gray, with brown and white being the minority. The common name for pigeons as "white pigeons" is unique to Cantonese, and is the result of a phonetic change from the ancient name for pigeons, "卧式鴿". (45) The pronunciation or writing of "ticket" as "biao" is also a phenomenon still retained in the Cantonese dialect. For example, in Hong Kong, the Cantonese language still refers to "horse tickets" as "馬標 (ticket)" and "winning horse tickets" as "中馬標 (ticket)". This proves that the "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery", which originated from the Portuguese lottery and was created in Macau, Guangdong, was created and officially named by the Cantonese.

What we _do_ know for sure is that it was first legalized in Macau by [<Noun
lang="pt">João Maria Ferreira do
Amaral</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Maria_Ferreira_do_Amaral)
(1803–1849), who authorized the game in January 1847, upon the request of local
Chinese businessmen.[@GamesOfChanceInMacau2 p. 110] Macau had been declared a
free port in 1845, hoping to increase trade and business under competition from
the recently-established British colony at Hong Kong (1842). Despite this, Macau
was still in decline and Amaral was under pressure to raise revenue. Attempts by
Amaral to introduce new taxes were unpopular and had even led to [an armed
revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Faiti%C3%B5es) in October
1846. Thus, a system was devised whereby monopoly rights for important goods
(including pork and beef, fish, salt, oysters and opium) were sold or auctioned
off.  Gambling monopolies were a logical extension of this idea.

The Macau Senate were unhappy with a number of the decisions made by the
governor, and complained directly to Lisbon that, among other things,

## Spread to other countries

The game travelled everywhere that Chinese people migrated to. In particular it
seems to have been popular in places with gold-fields where Chinese men came to
work in the late 19th century: San Francisco in the USA, British Columbia in
Canada, Victoria in Australia, and New Zealand.
