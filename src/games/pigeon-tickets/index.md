of his other (original) conclusions to be dubious).{%endfn%}) is a gambling game
which originated in <Noun lang="zh-Latn">Guangdong</Noun> during the late Qing
dynasty, and which in the 19th and 20th centuries was spread throughout
Oceania-bordering countries by Chinese emigrants. The game eventually turned
into the modern game of Keno, now played in casinos around the world.

{%aside%}
The @GuinnessMusicFacts [p. 266] states that the “first English
recording of a dance band with vocal refrain” was of a song entitled ‘Puck-a-Pu’, sung by
Ernest Pike with the Mayfair Dance Orchestra, on the 9th of November 1920. The recording can be
heard
[here](http://www.mgthomas.co.uk/Soundfiles/Ragtime/Mayfair%20Dance%20Orch%20-%20Puck-A-Pu.mp3). 
Note that it can best be described as “musical Chinoiserie”, and the lyrics are fairly racist.

In English reports the name of the game is usually given as
“pakapoo”/“pak-a-poo” or “pakapu”/“pak-a(h)-pu”. Other variants are “pak-a-peu”,
“puck-a-pu”, or “pac-a-poo”. In Macau it is given with the Portugeuse
romanization of “pacapio”, which remains standard in current usage.

While the specifics vary, the play of the game is simple: each player purchases
one or more tickets upon which they select a number of characters out of 80
different characters. The seller then randomly selects a number of characters at
random, and players win money according to the number of matching characters
marked on their ticket.

## False origins

It is sometimes fancifully claimed that the name of the game was because
originally white pigeons were used to choose winning tickets, but that is not
possible given the way the game is played; it is not a lottery where one or more
tickets are selected to be the winner(s).

According to current Chinese dictionaries, the game was a derivative of
pigeon-racing bets. The story runs that the characters were used to label
pigeons and players would select which pigeons to bet upon based on the
characters assigned to those pigeons. Eventually the pigeons were dropped
entirely and the characters were drawn at random. However, there is no record of
pigeon races and betting being performed in this manner.[@SparrowAndPigeon]

## Known history

What we _do_ know is that the game was first legalized in Macau by [<Noun
lang="pt">João Maria Ferreira do
Amaral</Noun>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Maria_Ferreira_do_Amaral)
(1803–1849), who authorized the game in January 1847, upon the request of local
Chinese businessmen.[@GamesOfChanceInMacau2 p. 110] Macau had been declared a
free port in 1845, hoping to increase trade and business under competition from
the recently-acquired British colony at Hong Kong (1842). Despite this, Macau
was still in decline and Amaral was under pressure to raise revenue. New taxes
introduced by Amaral were unpopular and had even led to [an armed
revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Faiti%C3%B5es) in October
1846. Thus, a system was devised whereby monopoly rights for important goods
(including pork and beef, fish, salt, oysters and opium) were sold or auctioned
off.  Gambling monopolies were a logical extension of this idea. 

The Macau Senate were unhappy with a number of the decisions made by the
governor, and complained directly to Lisbon that, among other things, 

> … the Chinese were given license to operate lotteries inside the city, a thing
> that the same Goverment which allowed it had just two months before forbidden
> as immoral and harmful to peacefulness and public tranquility.

Nevertheless, the game was permitted to continue and licenses to run <span
lang="pt">pacapio</span> began to be issued on an annual basis from April 5,
1848.

## Spread to other countries

The game travelled everywhere that Chinese people migrated to. In particular it
seems to have been popular in places with gold-fields where Chinese men came to
work in the late 19th century: San Francisco in the USA, British Columbia in
Canada, Victoria in Australia, and New Zealand.
