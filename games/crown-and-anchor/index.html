on textual evidence it seems to date from the late 19th century (at least in the
version played with the Crown and Anchor symbols), possibly derived from
pictorial versions of Chuck-A-Luck such as “Mustang”. In England there are
certainly many old references to “dice boards” or “gaming tables”, but they are
not described in detail very often.</p><p>At first, the game was played with symbols other than the crown and anchor. The
earliest reference I have found is to a version played with “anchors, stars,
clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds” at the coronation fair of George IV in Hyde
Park in 1821.<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">This is clearly the same game as six outcomes are listed

“clubs, spades, &#x26;c.” at a game at the races.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-GamblingAtTheRaces">e</a></sup> An 1864
newspaper article claims that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brodie">Deacon

anachronistic — in any case, it is still an early

Harding states that “some of the first pennies [he] earned was holding up the

person at each end, with a cloth on which the staking layout was painted placed
on top. The entire setup was designed to make it as easy as possible to

Australian troops. Sam Sutcliffe described a camp scene at

<p>Gambling was forbidden to us and, officially, it may have been to them, but a
mighty sight worth seeing was the Australian Crown And Anchor school. Soon
after dusk, quite some distance from their camp, a line of little lights would
commence to twinkle. Curiosity lured me over there, spiced by the knowledge
that, if our Military Police caught me near those wicked Aussies, I’d be in
real trouble.<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">English troops were not permitted to mingle with the
Australians.</span> I believe I planned to vanish into the dark desert if
trouble threatened, and make my merry way back to our camp later.</p>
<p>I found a long line of improvised desks, a space of several yards between each
of them. A couple of candles on each desk illuminated the Crown And Anchor
board — actually a leatherette sheet, easily folded up and pocketed in an
emergency, with the six symbols of the game printed on it. The operator sat on
a box and called out his line of persuasion or temptation, such as “Come on,
me lucky lads! The more you put down the more you pick up. Who’ll have a bet
on the old mudhook?”<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">i.e. anchor, see below.</span></p>
<p>Some operators always had a group of punters around them, others did less
business. Why should some be more successful than others, even there at the
edge of the desert? All had the same set-up, although they did vary the odds.
The lowest offer made was to double your money if the symbol you’d backed
turned up when the dice was thrown. Perhaps the variations which could be
introduced by ingenious operators attracted men who applied careful thought to
their gambling. Watching from my respectful distance, I was very impressed, at
times amazed, at the quantity of money which changed hands.</p>

the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Royal_Rifle_Corps">King’s Royal Rifle
Corps</a>:<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-JerryWinsABet">ag</a></sup></p><blockquote>
<p>Alf, who owned a Crown and Anchor board of great antiquity, had it spread out
on two petrol cans at the bottom of a shell-hole.</p>
<p>Around it four of us squatted and began to deposit thereon our dirty half- and
one-franc notes, with occasional coins of lesser value. The constant whistle
of passing fragments was punctuated by the voice of Alf calling upon the
company to “’ave a bit on the ’eart” or alternately to “’ave a dig in the
grave”, when a spent bullet crashed on his tin hat and fell with a thud into
the crown square.</p>
<p>“’struth,” gasped Alf, “old squarehead wants to back the sergeant-major.” He
gave a final shake to the cup and exposed the dice — one heart and two crowns.
“Blimey,” exclaimed Alf, “would yer blinkin’ well believe it? Jerry’s backed a
winner. ’Arf a mo,” and picking up the spent bullet, he threw it with all his
might towards the German lines, exclaiming, “’Ere’s yer blinking bet back,
Jerry, and ’ere’s yer winnings.” He cautiously fired two rounds.</p>
</blockquote><p>Similar samples of the proprietors’ patter resound from many memoirs of the war:<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-APrivateInTheGuards">r</a>[p. 178]</sup></p><blockquote>
<p>Where you lay we pay. Come and put your money with the lucky old man. I touch
the money, but I never touch the dice. Any more for the lucky old heart? Make
it even on the lucky old heart. Are you all done, gentlemen? … <em>Are you all
done?</em> … The diamond, meat-hook, and lucky old sergeant-major. (He shakes
the dice again.) Now, then, will any one down on his luck put a little bit of
snow (some silver) on the curse? Does any one say a bit of snow on the old
hook? Are you all done, gentlemen? <em>Are you all done?</em> … Cocked dice
are no man’s dice. Change your bets or double them! Now, then, <em>up she
comes again.</em> The mud-rake, the shamrock, and the lucky old heart. Copper
to copper, silver to silver, and <em>gold to gold</em> We shall have to drag
the old anchor a bit. (Rattles the dice.) Now who tries his luck on the name
of the game?</p>
</blockquote><p>Another report from Gallipoli in 1916 also mentions it being played in trenches,
and indicates that it was associated with “colonials” (Australians and New
Zealanders):<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-AnInterestingNarrative">ah</a></sup></p><blockquote>
<p>I am satisifed there is as much chance of stopping colonials gambling as old
Canute had of stopping the tide rising. I have see them playing “crown and
anchor,” a great game with them (don’t know if you ever saw it) in all sorts
of unlikely places, even on the fire step in first line trenches. It was funny
on the Ionian, going back to Egypt, when there was a church parade. The padre
paused in the sermon, and in the middle of the silence came a yell from behind
the deck-house, “Who’s going to put a bob on the lucky old mud hook?” whilst
straight on the bridge, and absolutely the nearest to the parson, was a ring
of men gambling all the time, and too straight under the parson for him to see
them. It did look comical…</p>

English <abbr title="non-commissioned officer">NCO</abbr>
school:<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-AtAnEnglishNCOSchool">ai</a></sup></p><blockquote>

“pounds, coins, or browns” lets one know that the popoular gambling game of
“crown and anchor,” for anything from a £1 note to a penny, is in progress.</p>
