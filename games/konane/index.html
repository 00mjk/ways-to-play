<section><h2 id="history"><a aria-hidden="" tabindex="-1" class="permalink" title="link to section" href="#history">#</a>History</h2><p><noun lang="haw">Kōnane</noun> stands alone as a purely-abstract game in
Hawaiian culture.<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">John F. G. Stokes (1875–1960, an Australian archæologist
on <noun lang="haw">Hawaiʻi</noun>) suggested at one point—with only a sliver of
linguistic evidence—that <noun lang="haw">Kōnane</noun> could be a distant
descendant of Go, which had been transmitted by the survivors of Japanese
shipwrecks.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-Stokes">a</a></sup></span>  However, it definitely existed before European
contact, as it was described by Captain Cook’s voyage, which was the first of
its kind to reach the islands (see below).</p><p>The game dates at least from the early 18th century, as it was played by
Kahekili II (c. 1737–1794), who was high chief (<span lang="haw">aliʻi
nui</span>) of Maui. Kahekili and his advisers possibly used the board, or at
least the pieces, to plan battles:</p><blockquote>
<p>[T]here was no other king so genuinely accomplished in making war as King
Kahekili of Maui and the actions on the battlefield plainly showed his
knowledge of the checkers game of war. […] It was also said that at the house
of Kahekili the heaps of little stones were maneuvered for battle strategy so
that his generals need only fulfill their movements.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-KamehamehaAndHisWarrior">b</a>[p. 41]</sup></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Not only were [the old <span lang="haw">kāhuna</span> of this land] seers, but
some of them used the <span lang="haw">papa kōnane hoʻoneʻe ʻiliʻili</span>
[<span lang="haw">kōnane</span> stones] to guide them in understanding the
movements on the battlefield.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-KamehamehaAndHisWarrior">b</a>[p. 123]</sup></p>
</blockquote><p>The gods were also rumoured to enjoy <span lang="haw">kōnane</span>: the volcano
goddess <noun lang="haw">Pele</noun> was said to play it at her home in <noun lang="haw">Hale-maʻumaʻu</noun> crater.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-Ellis17">c</a>[p. 183]</sup></p><p>The earliest written record we have of the game is from James King,<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">At the
time of the entry quoted, Captain Cook himself had been killed. James King
completed the official account of the voyage upon returning to England.</span>
who was an officer that sailed on board Captain Cook’s third voyage to the
Pacific.  In an entry dated March 1779, he wrote:</p><blockquote>
<p>It is very remarkable, that the people of theſe iſlands are great gamblers.
They have a game very much like our draughts; but, if one may judge from the
number of ſquares, it is much more intricate. The board is about two feet
long, and it is divided into two hundred and thirty-eight ſquares, of which
there are fourteen in a row, and they make uſe of black and white pebbles,
which they move from ſquare to ſquare.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-VoyageToPacific">d</a>[p. 144]</sup></p><p></p>
</blockquote><p>Another early witness was Archibald Campbell,<span class="footnote-indicator"></span><span role="note" class="footnote">Campbell arrived in <noun lang="haw">Hawaiʻi</noun> aboard the <em>Neva</em>, the first Russian ship to
circumnavigate the world, on the 29th of January 1809, and left aboard the
<em>Duke of Portland</em>, a whaler, on the 4th of March 1810. The <em>Duke of
Portland</em> also carried a letter from King Kamehameha to King George III, see
<a href="#ref-Hackler86">Hackler</a> (1986). More information about the ships is available in
<a href="#ref-Jackson92">Jackson</a> (1992).</span> a Scottish sailor who visited Oʻahu from
1809–1810. In his book, he described the game:</p><blockquote>
<p>They have a game somewhat resembling draughts, but more complicated. It is
played upon a board about twenty-two inches by fourteen, painted black, with
white spots, on which the men are placed; these consist of black and white
pebbles, eighteen upon each side, and the game is won by the capture of the
adversary’s pieces.</p>
<p>Tamaahmaah [King Kamehameha I, rumoured to be the son of Kahekili II] excels
at this game. I have seen him sit for hours playing with his chiefs, giving an
occasional smile, but without uttering a word. I could not play, but William
Moxely [Campbell’s interpreter], who understood it well, told me that he had
seen none who could beat the king.</p>
<p>The game of draughts is now introduced, and the natives play it uncommonly
well.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-AVoyageRoundTheWorld">g</a>[p. 145]</sup></p>
</blockquote><p>The area around where Kamehameha lived was called Kou, and was famous as being a
location for playing <span lang="haw">kōnane</span>.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-LegendsOfHonolulu">h</a>[p. 8]</sup> A
